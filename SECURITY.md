# Security Policy


## Supported Versions

We maintain security practices for the latest release of this library. Older versions may not receive security updates.


## Security Testing

This project is regularly tested for security issues using both:

- [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) static analysis (run via GitHub Actions)
- [Snyk](https://snyk.io) for continuous dependency vulnerability monitoring

All known transitive vulnerabilities have been manually triaged and either resolved or confirmed to be non-applicable based on how the library is used. See the repository's issue tracker or changelog for relevant audit notes when applicable.


## Data Privacy

This library uses LiteLLM as a local Python package to communicate with LLM providers using unified interface. No data or telemetry is transmitted to LiteLLM servers, as the SDK is run entirely within the user's environment. According to LiteLLM's documentation, self-hosted or local SDK use involves no data storage and no telemetry. For details, see [LiteLLM's documentation](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/data_security).
