      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n- Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.), includes a name,
      and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that
      might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n- Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph and, optionally, additional
      information about the paragraph, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      that paragraph's ID under the aspect's list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph
      does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4.
      Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be
      a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For
      each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The
      aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array
      of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary,
      code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse
      the following answer format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding
      text or ```json delimiters should be included).\\n\\n===\\nANSWER FORMAT (MANDATORY):\\n[\\n

      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n- Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.), includes a name,
      and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that
      might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n- Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph and, optionally, additional
      information about the paragraph, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      the paragraph's ID and provide a justification, detailing why the paragraph
      is relevant to the aspect.\\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect,
      do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final answer
      in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects,
      each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For each aspect (in the order
      they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier,
      e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph
      that addresses or relates to the aspect. Each object should include:\\n        ---
      paragraph_id: The provided paragraph ID, e.g., \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\".\\n        ---
      justification: A justification of why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect.
      Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the content of the paragraph
      to the aspect's defining features. Never reference the paragraph's ID in the
      justification.\\n            ---- Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight
      only the essential details.\\n            ---- Justification should be no longer
      than 2 sentences.\\n            ---- Justification should be in English.\\n
      \   -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty
      paragraphs array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers,
      or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse the following answer
      format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding text or ```json

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations

      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find document

      a justification of why the item was extracted for the concept. Ensure the justification
      is specific and directly ties the extracted item to the concept's defining features.

      matches that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for
      integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\\n    -- Do
      not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling
      missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n- Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.), includes a name,
      and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that
      might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n- Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph and, optionally, additional
      information about the paragraph, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      that paragraph's ID under the aspect's list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph
      does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4.
      Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be
      a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For
      each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The
      aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array
      of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary,
      code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse
      the following answer format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding
      text or ```json delimiters should be included).\\n\\n===\\nANSWER FORMAT (MANDATORY):\\n[\\n

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n- Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.), includes a name,
      and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that
      might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n- Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph and, optionally, additional
      information about the paragraph, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      the paragraph's ID and provide a justification, detailing why the paragraph
      is relevant to the aspect.\\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect,
      do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final answer
      in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects,
      each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For each aspect (in the order
      they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier,
      e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph
      that addresses or relates to the aspect. Each object should include:\\n        ---
      paragraph_id: The provided paragraph ID, e.g., \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\".\\n        ---
      justification: A justification of why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect.
      Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the content of the paragraph
      to the aspect's defining features. Never reference the paragraph's ID in the
      justification.\\n            ---- Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight
      only the essential details.\\n            ---- Justification should be no longer
      than 2 sentences.\\n            ---- Justification should be in English.\\n
      \   -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty
      paragraphs array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers,
      or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse the following answer
      format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding text or ```json
      delimiters should be included).\\n\\n===\\nANSWER FORMAT (MANDATORY):\\n[\\n

      any Confidential Information. The name of the dog of the Receiving Party is
      Bob.The designation of information as Confidential Information shall not be
      determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret under applicable
      law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive property of Disclosing
      Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license or otherwise, to
      use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided herein.3. Obligations
      of Receiving Party:The party receiving Confidential Information (\\\"Receiving
      Party\\\") shall:a. Maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information

      cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which monetary damages would
      be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief, the Receiving Party
      shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of $25,000 for each instance
      of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information, which the parties
      agree represents a reasonable estimate of the damages likely to be suffered
      and not a penalty.7. No License:Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed
      as granting any rights to the Receiving Party, by license or otherwise, to any
      of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information, except as expressly
      set forth in this Agreement.8. Governing Law and Disputes:This Agreement shall

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find document

      When extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\\n    -- justification: Mandatory field holding
      a justification of why the item was extracted for the concept. Ensure the justification
      is specific and directly ties the extracted item to the concept's defining features.
      Never reference the concept's ID in the justification.\\n        --- Justification
      should be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential details.\\n        --- Justification

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's

      information about the sentence, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n
      \   - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document.\\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed
      within the document paragraphs.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract
      zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure are
      specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted

      and directly ties the extracted item to the concept's defining features. Never
      reference the concept's ID in the justification.\\n        --- Justification
      should be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential details.\\n        --- Justification
      should be no longer than 2 sentences.\\n        --- Justification should be
      in English.\\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph
      based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each object should include:\\n

      ID for the paragraph (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.).\\n        ---
      reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array of the provided IDs

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n- Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.), includes a name,
      and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that
      might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n- Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph and, optionally, additional
      information about the paragraph, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      that paragraph's ID under the aspect's list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph
      does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4.
      Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be
      a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For
      each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The
      aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array
      of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary,
      code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n- Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.), includes a name,
      and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that
      might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n- Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph and, optionally, additional
      information about the paragraph, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      the paragraph's ID and provide a justification, detailing why the paragraph
      is relevant to the aspect.\\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect,
      do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final answer
      in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects,
      each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For each aspect (in the order
      they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier,
      e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph
      that addresses or relates to the aspect. Each object should include:\\n        ---
      paragraph_id: The provided paragraph ID, e.g., \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\".\\n        ---
      justification: A justification of why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect.
      Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the content of the paragraph
      to the aspect's defining features. Never reference the paragraph's ID in the
      justification.\\n            ---- Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight
      only the essential details.\\n            ---- Justification should be no longer
      than 2 sentences.\\n            ---- Justification should be in English.\\n
      \   -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty
      paragraphs array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers,
      or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse the following answer
      format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding text or ```json
      delimiters should be included).\\n\\n===\\nANSWER FORMAT (MANDATORY):\\n[\\n

      information about the sentence, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n
      \   - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document.\\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed
      within the document paragraphs.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract
      zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure are
      specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      paragraphs, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with
      an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list.\\n\\nFollow these additional rules:\\n\\n-
      Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following answer format (do
      not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\\n\\n-
      Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\"
      and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match
      exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n
      \   -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an array of objects with
      mandatory fields \\\"value\\\", \\\"justification\\\", and \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\".
      If the concept is not found or there are no items to extract, leave the array
      empty ([]).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted
      items for the concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\".
      Each extracted item's object, even if there is only one, must be part of the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n        --- The value of \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\"
      must be an array of objects with mandatory fields \\\"reference_paragraph_id\\\",
      which holds the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \\\"reference_sentence_ids\\\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.

      should follow the same style and formatting.\\n        --- When extracting string
      values, translate them in English if the original language of the document is
      not English.\\n    -- justification: Mandatory field holding a justification
      of why the item was extracted for the concept. Ensure the justification is specific
      and directly ties the extracted item to the concept's defining features. Never
      reference the concept's ID in the justification.\\n        --- Justification
      should be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential details.\\n        --- Justification
      should be no longer than 2 sentences.\\n        --- Justification should be
      in English.\\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph
      based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each object should include:\\n
      \       --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field holding the provided ID
      of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match exactly the provided
      ID for the paragraph (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.).\\n        ---
      reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array of the provided IDs
      of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the item was extracted
      for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the provided ID for the
      sentence (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S2\\\", etc.).\\n\\n- Types of
      extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item type\\\"
      (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure that the value of
      each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type. Python
      types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point
      number, dict for object, etc.).\\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or
      modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling missing or multiple items:\\n
      \   -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still contain
      an entry for that concept with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    --
      If multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry
      within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n    --

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document

      shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of $25,000 for each instance
      of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information, which the parties
      agree represents a reasonable estimate of the damages likely to be suffered

      array.\\n    -- If multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a
      separate entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional
      text:\\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of
      the JSON array.\\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any

      any Confidential Information. The name of the dog of the Receiving Party is
      Bob.The designation of information as Confidential Information shall not be
      determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret under applicable
      law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive property of Disclosing
      Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license or otherwise, to
      use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided herein.3. Obligations

      cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which monetary damages would
      be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief, the Receiving Party
      shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of $25,000 for each instance
      of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information, which the parties
      agree represents a reasonable estimate of the damages likely to be suffered
      and not a penalty.7. No License:Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed
      as granting any rights to the Receiving Party, by license or otherwise, to any

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list

      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n- Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.), includes a name,
      and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that
      might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n- Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph and, optionally, additional
      information about the paragraph, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      that paragraph's ID under the aspect's list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find document
