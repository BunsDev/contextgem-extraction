    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects. Your task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n-
      Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\",
      etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes,
      topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine
      each paragraph\\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example,
      \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\\n-
      When available, additional context information for paragraphs (such as formatting,
      list context, or table position) will be provided under \\\"Additional information
      about the paragraph:\\\" sections, which provides important context for understanding
      their structural role and position within the document. Use this information
      to:\\n    -- Understand document hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section
      boundaries)\\n    -- Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list items
      are related, table cells contain associated data)\\n    -- Assess content significance
      (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)\\n- Note that paragraphs are provided
      in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings,
      links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n- Note that paragraphs are listed
      in the same order they appear in the original document; therefore, context from
      surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular paragraph is relevant
      to an aspect.\\n- You may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      that paragraph's ID under the aspect's list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph
      does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4.
      Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be
      a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For
      each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The
      aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array
      of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary,
      code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse
      the following answer format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding
      text or ```json delimiters should be included).\\n\\n======\\nANSWER FORMAT

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects. Your task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n-
      Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\",
      etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes,
      topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine
      each paragraph\\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example,
      \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\\n-
      When available, additional context information for paragraphs (such as formatting,
      list context, or table position) will be provided under \\\"Additional information
      about the paragraph:\\\" sections, which provides important context for understanding
      their structural role and position within the document. Use this information
      to:\\n    -- Understand document hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section
      boundaries)\\n    -- Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list items
      are related, table cells contain associated data)\\n    -- Assess content significance
      (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)\\n- Note that paragraphs are provided
      in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings,
      links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n- Note that paragraphs are listed
      in the same order they appear in the original document; therefore, context from
      surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular paragraph is relevant
      to an aspect.\\n- You may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      the paragraph's ID and provide a justification, detailing why the paragraph
      is relevant to the aspect.\\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect,
      do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final answer
      in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects,
      each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For each aspect (in the order
      they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier,
      e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph
      that addresses or relates to the aspect. Each object should include:\\n        ---
      paragraph_id: The provided paragraph ID, e.g., \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\".\\n        ---
      justification: A justification of why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect.
      Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the content of the paragraph
      to the aspect's defining features. Never reference any of the structural IDs
      provided in this prompt (such as aspect IDs like \\\"A0\\\", or paragraph IDs
      like \\\"P0\\\") in the justification.\\n            ---- Justification should
      be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential details.\\n            ---- Justification
      should be no longer than 2 sentences.\\n            ---- Justification should
      be in English.\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraphs array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary, code
      block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse the following
      answer format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding text
      or ```json delimiters should be included).\\n\\n======\\nANSWER FORMAT (MANDATORY):\\n[\\n

    body: '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You will be assigned tasks involving
      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file containing
      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints,
      photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\n-
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger
      document and should be analyzed within their limited context. When working with
      fragments, focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain textual or
      visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can be directly
      read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints,
      tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --
      The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\n  -- The expected output
      format and structure requirements\n  -- Any constraints or special handling
      instructions\n\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n  -- All
      extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n  --
      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --
      Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field
      names\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code
      blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n-
      Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the
      task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions,
      include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when
      required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or
      noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References (when required):
      When required by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted
      data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering
      to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across
      diverse document analysis tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"Below you will
      find document text and a list of concepts.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Read through
      the document text provided.\n    - Note that the document text is provided in
      markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings, links,
      lists, and other markdown syntax.\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts
      list is addressed within the document text.\n3. For each concept that appears,
      extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure
      are specified for each concept.\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\n\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      text, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" list. However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n- Extract True if the concept is confirmed
      or strongly supported by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably
      inferred)\n- Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the
      document content allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g.,
      absence of expected content that should be present if the concept were true)\n-
      Only leave \"extracted_items\" empty if the concept is impossible to determine
      because either: (1) the document is completely irrelevant to the concept, or
      (2) the document does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about
      the concept\n\nFollow these additional rules:\n\n- Output format:\nProvide your
      answer in only the following answer format (do not include backticks, code fences,
      or any introductory/explanatory text).\n\n- Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object
      in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\" and \"extracted_items\".\n    --
      The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value of \"extracted_items\" must be an array.
      If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the
      array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept is impossible
      to determine.\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly
      mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information
      present).\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items
      for the concept is specified under \"Amount of extracted items\". Each extracted
      item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n-
      Item structure:\n    -- All extracted items must match the exact type specified
      for the concept.\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for a concept under
      \"Expected structure,\" you must follow that structure for all extracted items
      corresponding to that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept
      under \"Rating scale,\" the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    --
      If available labels are provided for a concept under \"Available labels,\" the
      extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined
      set. If none of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that
      concept.\n    -- If there are example items (\"Extracted concept examples\"),
      try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n    --
      When extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\n\n- Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each
      concept specifies an \"extracted item type\" (found under \"Concept extracted
      item type\"). Ensure your extracted items strictly match that type. Python types
      are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point
      number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation
      will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or
      modify the specified structure.\n\n- Handling missing or multiple items:\n    --
      If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still contain an entry
      for that concept with an empty \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean
      concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between
      these cases:\n        --- Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly
      supported by the provided content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        ---
      Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content
      allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected
      content that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave
      \"extracted_items\" empty if the concept is impossible to determine because
      either: (1) the provided content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or
      (2) the provided content does not contain enough information to make a conclusion
      about the concept\n    -- For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section:
      if none of the predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \"extracted_items\"
      array empty.\n    -- For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g.,
      {\"labels\": [\"label1\", \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items
      if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\n    -- For concepts that do not have an \"Available labels:\"
      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n- No additional text:\n    --
      Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON array.\n    --

    body: '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You will be assigned tasks involving
      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file containing
      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints,
      photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\n-
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger
      document and should be analyzed within their limited context. When working with
      fragments, focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain textual or
      visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can be directly
      read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints,
      tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --
      The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\n  -- The expected output
      format and structure requirements\n  -- Any constraints or special handling
      instructions\n\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n  -- All
      extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n  --
      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --
      Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field
      names\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code
      blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n-
      Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the
      task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions,
      include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when
      required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or
      noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References (when required):
      When required by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted
      data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering
      to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across
      diverse document analysis tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"Below you will
      find a list of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list of concepts.\n\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\n    -
      Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\",
      etc.).\n    - Each paragraph includes sentences, each identified by a sentence
      ID (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S1\", etc.), followed by the full text of the
      sentence.\n    - When available, additional context information for paragraphs
      and sentences (such as formatting, list context, or table position) will be
      provided under \"Additional information about the paragraph:\" and \"Additional
      information about the sentence:\" sections, which provides important context
      for understanding their structural role and position within the document. Use
      this information to:\n        -- Understand document hierarchy (e.g., headings
      indicate section boundaries)\n        -- Recognize relationships between content
      (e.g., list items are related, table cells contain associated data)\n        --
      Assess content significance (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)\n    -
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document.\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n2. Identify whether each concept in
      the concepts list is addressed within the document paragraphs.\n3. For each
      concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The
      item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4. Produce a JSON
      array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n\nIf a concept
      is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n-
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n- Extract False if
      the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you to
      determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content that
      should be present if the concept were true)\n- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\nProvide your answer in only the following answer
      format (do not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory
      text).\n\n- Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two
      keys: \"concept_id\" and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\"
      must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    --
      The value of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory
      fields \"value\", \"justification\", and \"reference_paragraphs\". If the concept
      is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).
      For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        ---
      Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from
      the content (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        ---
      Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is
      specified under \"Amount of extracted items\". Each extracted item''s object,
      even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n        ---
      The value of \"reference_paragraphs\" must be an array of objects with mandatory
      fields \"reference_paragraph_id\", which holds the provided ID of the reference
      paragraph, and \"reference_sentence_ids\", which holds the provided IDs of the
      reference sentences within the paragraph. Note that not every sentence in the
      paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant reference.\n\n- Item object structure:\n    --
      value: Mandatory field holding the extracted item. Must match the exact type
      specified for the concept.\n        --- If a specific structure is provided
      for a concept under \"Expected structure,\" the extracted item value must follow
      that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\n        ---
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \"Rating scale,\" the extracted
      item value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided

      list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none of the predefined
      labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\n        --- If there
      are example items (\"Extracted concept examples\"), the extracted item value
      should follow the same style and formatting.\n        --- When extracting string
      values, translate them in English if the original language of the document is
      not English.\n    -- justification: Mandatory field holding a justification
      of why the item was extracted for the concept. Ensure the justification is specific
      and directly ties the extracted item to the concept''s defining features. Never
      reference the concept''s ID or any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt
      (such as paragraph IDs like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\") in the justification.\n        ---
      Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential details.\n        ---
      Justification should be no longer than 2 sentences.\n        --- Justification
      should be in English.\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects for
      each paragraph based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each object
      should include:\n        --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field holding
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match exactly
      the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.).\n        ---
      reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array of the provided IDs
      of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the item was extracted
      for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the provided ID for the
      sentence (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\", etc.).\n\n- Types of extracted
      items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item type\" (found under
      \"Concept extracted item type\"). Ensure that the value of each of the extracted
      items for the concept strictly matches that type. Python types are provided
      (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict
      for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result
      in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified
      structure.\n\n- Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is
      not mentioned at all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept
      with an empty \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with

    body: '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You will be assigned tasks involving
      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file containing
      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints,
      photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\n-
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger
      document and should be analyzed within their limited context. When working with
      fragments, focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain textual or
      visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can be directly
      read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints,
      tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --
      The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\n  -- The expected output
      format and structure requirements\n  -- Any constraints or special handling
      instructions\n\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n  -- All
      extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n  --
      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --
      Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field
      names\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code
      blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n-
      Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the
      task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions,
      include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when
      required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or
      noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References (when required):
      When required by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted
      data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering
      to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across
      diverse document analysis tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"Below you will
      find document text and a list of concepts.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Read through
      the document text provided.\n    - Note that the document text is provided in
      markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings, links,
      lists, and other markdown syntax.\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts
      list is addressed within the document text.\n3. For each concept that appears,
      extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure
      are specified for each concept.\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\n\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      text, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" list. However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n- Extract True if the concept is confirmed
      or strongly supported by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably
      inferred)\n- Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the
      document content allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g.,
      absence of expected content that should be present if the concept were true)\n-
      Only leave \"extracted_items\" empty if the concept is impossible to determine
      because either: (1) the document is completely irrelevant to the concept, or
      (2) the document does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about
      the concept\n\nFollow these additional rules:\n\n- Output format:\nProvide your
      answer in only the following answer format (do not include backticks, code fences,
      or any introductory/explanatory text).\n\n- Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object
      in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\" and \"extracted_items\".\n    --
      The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value of \"extracted_items\" must be an array.
      If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the
      array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept is impossible
      to determine.\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly
      mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information
      present).\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items
      for the concept is specified under \"Amount of extracted items\". Each extracted
      item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n-
      Item structure:\n    -- All extracted items must match the exact type specified
      for the concept.\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for a concept under
      \"Expected structure,\" you must follow that structure for all extracted items
      corresponding to that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept
      under \"Rating scale,\" the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    --
      If available labels are provided for a concept under \"Available labels,\" the
      extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined
      set. If none of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that
      concept.\n    -- If there are example items (\"Extracted concept examples\"),
      try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n    --
      When extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\n\n- Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each
      concept specifies an \"extracted item type\" (found under \"Concept extracted
      item type\"). Ensure your extracted items strictly match that type. Python types
      are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point
      number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation
      will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or
      modify the specified structure.\n\n- Handling missing or multiple items:\n    --
      If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still contain an entry
      for that concept with an empty \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean
      concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between
      these cases:\n        --- Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly
      supported by the provided content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        ---
      Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content
      allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected
      content that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave
      \"extracted_items\" empty if the concept is impossible to determine because
      either: (1) the provided content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or
      (2) the provided content does not contain enough information to make a conclusion
      about the concept\n    -- For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section:
      if none of the predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \"extracted_items\"
      array empty.\n    -- For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g.,
      {\"labels\": [\"label1\", \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items
      if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\n    -- For concepts that do not have an \"Available labels:\"
      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n- No additional text:\n    --
      Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON array.\n    --
      Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other formatting characters.\n\n======\nANSWER

      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n\\nYour task is to:\\n1.
      Read through the document text provided.\\n    - Note that the document text
      is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as
      headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n2. Identify whether each
      concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n3. For
      each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept.
      The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a
      JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a
      concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n-
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following
      answer format (do not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory
      text).\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two
      keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of
      \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\",
      \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an
      array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave
      the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly
      (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from
      the information present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount
      of extracted items for the concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted
      items\\\". Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- Item structure:\\n    -- All extracted
      items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\\n    -- If a specific
      structure is provided for a concept under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" you must
      follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n
      \   -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\"
      the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available labels
      are provided for a concept under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item
      value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none
      of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\\n
      \   -- If there are example items (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"), try
      to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\\n    -- When
      extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\\n\\n- Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each
      concept specifies an \\\"extracted item type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted
      item type\\\"). Ensure your extracted items strictly match that type. Python
      types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point
      number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation
      will result in invalid output.\\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or
      modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling missing or multiple items:\\n
      \   -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still contain
      an entry for that concept with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    --
      For boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully
      between these cases:\\n        --- Extract True if the concept is confirmed
      or strongly supported by the provided content (either explicitly stated or reasonably
      inferred)\\n        --- Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied,
      or if the provided content allows you to determine that the concept is not true
      (e.g., absence of expected content that should be present if the concept were
      true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\" empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided content is completely
      irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content does not contain enough
      information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n    -- For concepts that
      have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if none of the predefined labels
      apply to the content, leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty.\\n    --
      For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if multiple labels
      apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g., {\\\"labels\\\":
      [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if
      there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if
      multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within
      the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n    -- Do not

      of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information that may be disclosed
      between the parties during discussions and engagements regarding potential business
      collaborations and partnerships.\\n\\n## Definition of Confidential Information\\n\\nFor
      purposes of this Agreement, \\\"Confidential Information\\\" means any and all
      non-public information, conveyed in all forms, whether in oral, written, electronic,
      or other form or media, whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified
      as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has been or may be disclosed to, accessed by,
      or observed by Receiving Party, which (i) has actual or potential economic value
      by virtue of not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable
      by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure
      or use, or (ii) is subject to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain
      its secrecy and confidentiality.\\n\\nConfidential Information includes, but
      is not limited to, the following categories: (1) business information (business
      plans, strategies, and models), (2) technical information (technical specifications
      and documentation, research and development activities), (3) customer and market
      information (customer lists and contact information, sales histories and patterns),
      (4) personnel and internal information (employee lists and contact information,
      employment agreements and personnel files), (5) intellectual property (trade
      secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications, copyrights and copyright
      applications, trademarks and trademark applications), (6) strategic information
      (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses and strategies). Software
      code shall also be included into the confidential information.\\n\\nConfidential
      Information shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally
      available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Receiving Party
      or its Representatives; (b) was available to Receiving Party on a non-confidential
      basis prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) becomes available to
      Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a person other than Disclosing
      Party who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality obligation to Disclosing
      Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving Party without reference
      to or use of any Confidential Information. The name of the dog of the Receiving
      Party is Bob.\\n\\nThe designation of information as Confidential Information
      shall not be determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret
      under applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive
      property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license
      or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided
      herein.\\n\\n## Obligations of Receiving Party\\n\\nThe party receiving Confidential
      Information (\\\"Receiving Party\\\") shall:\\n\\n1. Maintain the confidentiality
      of the Confidential Information and not disclose it to any third party without
      the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\\n\\n2. Use the Confidential
      Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging in the potential
      business collaboration.\\n\\n3. Take all necessary precautions to protect the
      confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall be no less than
      the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\\n\\n##
      Exclusions from Confidential Information\\n\\nConfidential Information does
      not include information that:\\n\\n1. Is or becomes publicly known through no
      wrongful act of the Receiving Party.\\n\\n2. Is already known to the Receiving
      Party at the time of disclosure.\\n\\n3. Is lawfully received from a third party
      without breach of this Agreement.\\n\\n4. Is independently developed by the
      Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential
      Information.\\n\\n## Return of Materials\\n\\nUpon termination of this Agreement
      or upon request, the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing Confidential
      Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party's
      discretion.\\n\\n## Liability\\n\\n1. Total Liability Cap:\\n\\nThe total liability
      of either party for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement,
      whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i)
      $100,000 or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing
      Party under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of
      liability is cumulative and not per incident.\\n\\n2. Penalties for Breach:\\n\\nIn
      the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\\n\\n## No License\\n\\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving
      Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential
      Information, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.\\n\\n## Governing
      Law and Disputes\\n\\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
      with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of
      law principles.\\n\\nAll disputes shall be resolved by the courts of the State
      of California. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of five (5)
      years from the date of signing this agreement.\\n\\n## Miscellaneous\\n\\n1.
      This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
      to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral
      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\\n\\n2. Any amendments
      or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both
      parties.\\n\\n3. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable,
      the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision
      shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\\n\\n4.
      The Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\\n\\nIN
      WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement

      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n\\nYour task is to:\\n1.
      Read through the document text provided.\\n    - Note that the document text
      is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as
      headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n2. Identify whether each
      concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n3. For
      each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept.
      The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a
      JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a
      concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n-
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following
      answer format (do not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory
      text).\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two
      keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of
      \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\",
      \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an
      array of objects with mandatory fields \\\"value\\\" and \\\"justification\\\".
      If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the
      array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept is impossible
      to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly
      mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information
      present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted
      items for the concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\".
      Each extracted item's object, even if there is only one, must be part of the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- Item object structure:\\n    -- value:
      Mandatory field holding the extracted item. Must match the exact type specified
      for the concept.\\n        --- If a specific structure is provided for a concept
      under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" the extracted item value must follow that
      structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n        ---
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\" the
      extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n        --- If available labels
      are provided for a concept under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item
      value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none
      of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\\n
      \       --- If there are example items (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"),
      the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\\n        ---
      When extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\\n    -- justification: Mandatory field holding
      a justification of why the item was extracted for the concept. Ensure the justification
      is specific and directly ties the extracted item to the concept's defining features.
      Never reference the concept's ID or any of the structural IDs provided in this
      prompt (such as paragraph IDs like \\\"P0\\\", or sentence IDs like \\\"P0-S0\\\")
      in the justification.\\n        --- Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight
      only the essential details.\\n        --- Justification should be no longer
      than 2 sentences.\\n        --- Justification should be in English.\\n\\n- Types
      of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item type\\\"
      (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure that the value of
      each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type. Python
      types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point
      number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation
      will result in invalid output.\\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or
      modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling missing or multiple items:\\n
      \   -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still contain
      an entry for that concept with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    --
      For boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully
      between these cases:\\n        --- Extract True if the concept is confirmed
      or strongly supported by the provided content (either explicitly stated or reasonably
      inferred)\\n        --- Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied,
      or if the provided content allows you to determine that the concept is not true
      (e.g., absence of expected content that should be present if the concept were
      true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\" empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided content is completely
      irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content does not contain enough
      information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n    -- For concepts that
      have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if none of the predefined labels
      apply to the content, leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty.\\n    --
      For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if multiple labels
      apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g., {\\\"labels\\\":
      [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if
      there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if
      multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within
      the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n    -- Do not

      of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information that may be disclosed
      between the parties during discussions and engagements regarding potential business
      collaborations and partnerships.\\n\\n## Definition of Confidential Information\\n\\nFor
      purposes of this Agreement, \\\"Confidential Information\\\" means any and all
      non-public information, conveyed in all forms, whether in oral, written, electronic,
      or other form or media, whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified
      as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has been or may be disclosed to, accessed by,
      or observed by Receiving Party, which (i) has actual or potential economic value
      by virtue of not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable
      by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure
      or use, or (ii) is subject to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain
      its secrecy and confidentiality.\\n\\nConfidential Information includes, but
      is not limited to, the following categories: (1) business information (business
      plans, strategies, and models), (2) technical information (technical specifications
      and documentation, research and development activities), (3) customer and market
      information (customer lists and contact information, sales histories and patterns),
      (4) personnel and internal information (employee lists and contact information,
      employment agreements and personnel files), (5) intellectual property (trade
      secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications, copyrights and copyright
      applications, trademarks and trademark applications), (6) strategic information
      (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses and strategies). Software
      code shall also be included into the confidential information.\\n\\nConfidential
      Information shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally
      available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Receiving Party
      or its Representatives; (b) was available to Receiving Party on a non-confidential
      basis prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) becomes available to
      Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a person other than Disclosing
      Party who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality obligation to Disclosing
      Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving Party without reference
      to or use of any Confidential Information. The name of the dog of the Receiving
      Party is Bob.\\n\\nThe designation of information as Confidential Information
      shall not be determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret
      under applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive
      property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license
      or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided
      herein.\\n\\n## Obligations of Receiving Party\\n\\nThe party receiving Confidential
      Information (\\\"Receiving Party\\\") shall:\\n\\n1. Maintain the confidentiality
      of the Confidential Information and not disclose it to any third party without
      the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\\n\\n2. Use the Confidential
      Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging in the potential
      business collaboration.\\n\\n3. Take all necessary precautions to protect the
      confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall be no less than
      the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\\n\\n##
      Exclusions from Confidential Information\\n\\nConfidential Information does
      not include information that:\\n\\n1. Is or becomes publicly known through no
      wrongful act of the Receiving Party.\\n\\n2. Is already known to the Receiving
      Party at the time of disclosure.\\n\\n3. Is lawfully received from a third party
      without breach of this Agreement.\\n\\n4. Is independently developed by the
      Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential
      Information.\\n\\n## Return of Materials\\n\\nUpon termination of this Agreement
      or upon request, the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing Confidential
      Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party's
      discretion.\\n\\n## Liability\\n\\n1. Total Liability Cap:\\n\\nThe total liability
      of either party for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement,
      whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i)
      $100,000 or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing
      Party under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of
      liability is cumulative and not per incident.\\n\\n2. Penalties for Breach:\\n\\nIn
      the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\\n\\n## No License\\n\\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving
      Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential
      Information, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.\\n\\n## Governing
      Law and Disputes\\n\\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
      with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of
      law principles.\\n\\nAll disputes shall be resolved by the courts of the State
      of California. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of five (5)
      years from the date of signing this agreement.\\n\\n## Miscellaneous\\n\\n1.
      This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
      to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral
      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\\n\\n2. Any amendments
      or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both
      parties.\\n\\n3. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable,
      the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision
      shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\\n\\n4.
      The Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\\n\\nIN
      WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement

      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects. Your task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n-
      Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\",
      etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes,
      topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine
      each paragraph\\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example,
      \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\\n-
      When available, additional context information for paragraphs (such as formatting,
      list context, or table position) will be provided under \\\"Additional information
      about the paragraph:\\\" sections, which provides important context for understanding
      their structural role and position within the document. Use this information
      to:\\n    -- Understand document hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section
      boundaries)\\n    -- Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list items
      are related, table cells contain associated data)\\n    -- Assess content significance
      (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)\\n- Note that paragraphs are provided
      in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings,
      links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n- Note that paragraphs are listed
      in the same order they appear in the original document; therefore, context from
      surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular paragraph is relevant
      to an aspect.\\n- You may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      that paragraph's ID under the aspect's list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph
      does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4.
      Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be
      a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For
      each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The
      aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array
      of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary,
      code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse
      the following answer format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding
      text or ```json delimiters should be included).\\n\\n======\\nANSWER FORMAT

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects. Your task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n-
      Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\",
      etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes,
      topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine
      each paragraph\\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example,
      \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\\n-
      When available, additional context information for paragraphs (such as formatting,
      list context, or table position) will be provided under \\\"Additional information
      about the paragraph:\\\" sections, which provides important context for understanding
      their structural role and position within the document. Use this information
      to:\\n    -- Understand document hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section
      boundaries)\\n    -- Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list items
      are related, table cells contain associated data)\\n    -- Assess content significance
      (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)\\n- Note that paragraphs are provided
      in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings,
      links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n- Note that paragraphs are listed
      in the same order they appear in the original document; therefore, context from
      surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular paragraph is relevant
      to an aspect.\\n- You may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      the paragraph's ID and provide a justification, detailing why the paragraph
      is relevant to the aspect.\\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect,
      do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final answer
      in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects,
      each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For each aspect (in the order
      they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier,
      e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph
      that addresses or relates to the aspect. Each object should include:\\n        ---
      paragraph_id: The provided paragraph ID, e.g., \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\".\\n        ---
      justification: A justification of why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect.
      Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the content of the paragraph
      to the aspect's defining features. Never reference any of the structural IDs
      provided in this prompt (such as aspect IDs like \\\"A0\\\", or paragraph IDs
      like \\\"P0\\\") in the justification.\\n            ---- Justification should
      be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential details.\\n            ---- Justification
      should be no longer than 2 sentences.\\n            ---- Justification should
      be in English.\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraphs array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary, code
      block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse the following
      answer format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding text
      or ```json delimiters should be included).\\n\\n======\\nANSWER FORMAT (MANDATORY):\\n[\\n

    body: '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You will be assigned tasks involving
      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file containing
      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints,
      photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\n-
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger
      document and should be analyzed within their limited context. When working with
      fragments, focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain textual or
      visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can be directly
      read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints,
      tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --
      The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\n  -- The expected output
      format and structure requirements\n  -- Any constraints or special handling
      instructions\n\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n  -- All
      extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n  --
      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --
      Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field
      names\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code
      blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n-
      Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the
      task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions,
      include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when
      required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or
      noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References (when required):
      When required by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted
      data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering
      to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across
      diverse document analysis tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"Below you will
      find document text and a list of concepts.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Read through
      the document text provided.\n    - Note that the document text is provided in
      markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings, links,
      lists, and other markdown syntax.\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts
      list is addressed within the document text.\n3. For each concept that appears,
      extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure
      are specified for each concept.\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\n\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      text, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" list. However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n- Extract True if the concept is confirmed
      or strongly supported by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably
      inferred)\n- Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the
      document content allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g.,
      absence of expected content that should be present if the concept were true)\n-
      Only leave \"extracted_items\" empty if the concept is impossible to determine
      because either: (1) the document is completely irrelevant to the concept, or
      (2) the document does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about
      the concept\n\nFollow these additional rules:\n\n- Output format:\nProvide your
      answer in only the following answer format (do not include backticks, code fences,
      or any introductory/explanatory text).\n\n- Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object
      in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\" and \"extracted_items\".\n    --
      The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value of \"extracted_items\" must be an array.
      If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the
      array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept is impossible
      to determine.\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly
      mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information
      present).\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items
      for the concept is specified under \"Amount of extracted items\". Each extracted
      item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n-
      Item structure:\n    -- All extracted items must match the exact type specified
      for the concept.\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for a concept under

      corresponding to that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept
      under \"Rating scale,\" the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    --
      If available labels are provided for a concept under \"Available labels,\" the
      extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined
      set. If none of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that

      item type\"). Ensure your extracted items strictly match that type. Python types

      concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between
      these cases:\n        --- Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly
      supported by the provided content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        ---
      Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content
      allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected
      content that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave
      \"extracted_items\" empty if the concept is impossible to determine because
      either: (1) the provided content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or
      (2) the provided content does not contain enough information to make a conclusion
      about the concept\n    -- For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section:
      if none of the predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \"extracted_items\"
      array empty.\n    -- For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g.,
      {\"labels\": [\"label1\", \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items
      if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\n    -- For concepts that do not have an \"Available labels:\"
      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n- No additional text:\n    --

    body: '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You will be assigned tasks involving
      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file containing
      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints,
      photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\n-
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger
      document and should be analyzed within their limited context. When working with
      fragments, focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain textual or
      visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can be directly
      read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints,
      tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --
      The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\n  -- The expected output
      format and structure requirements\n  -- Any constraints or special handling
      instructions\n\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n  -- All
      extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n  --
      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --
      Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field
      names\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code
      blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n-
      Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the
      task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions,
      include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when
      required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or
      noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References (when required):
      When required by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted
      data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering
      to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across
      diverse document analysis tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"Below you will
      find document text and a list of concepts.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Read through
      the document text provided.\n    - Note that the document text is provided in
      markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings, links,
      lists, and other markdown syntax.\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts
      list is addressed within the document text.\n3. For each concept that appears,
      extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure
      are specified for each concept.\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\n\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      text, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty

      for the concept is specified under \"Amount of extracted items\". Each extracted
      item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n-
      Item structure:\n    -- All extracted items must match the exact type specified

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n\\nYour task is to:\\n1.
      Read through the document text provided.\\n    - Note that the document text
      is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as
      headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n2. Identify whether each
      concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n3. For
      each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept.
      The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a
      JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a
      concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n-
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following
      answer format (do not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory
      text).\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two
      keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of
      \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\",
      \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an
      array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave
      the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly
      (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from
      the information present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount
      of extracted items for the concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted
      items\\\". Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- Item structure:\\n    -- All extracted
      items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\\n    -- If a specific
      structure is provided for a concept under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" you must
      follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n
      \   -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\"
      the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available labels
      are provided for a concept under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item
      value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none
      of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\\n
      \   -- If there are example items (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"), try
      to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\\n    -- When
      extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\\n\\n- Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each
      concept specifies an \\\"extracted item type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted
      item type\\\"). Ensure your extracted items strictly match that type. Python
      types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point
      number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation
      will result in invalid output.\\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or
      modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling missing or multiple items:\\n
      \   -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still contain
      an entry for that concept with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    --
      For boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully
      between these cases:\\n        --- Extract True if the concept is confirmed
      or strongly supported by the provided content (either explicitly stated or reasonably
      inferred)\\n        --- Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied,
      or if the provided content allows you to determine that the concept is not true
      (e.g., absence of expected content that should be present if the concept were
      true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\" empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided content is completely
      irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content does not contain enough
      information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n    -- For concepts that
      have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if none of the predefined labels
      apply to the content, leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty.\\n    --
      For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if multiple labels
      apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g., {\\\"labels\\\":
      [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if
      there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if
      multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within
      the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n    -- Do not
      include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON array.\\n    --

      of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information that may be disclosed
      between the parties during discussions and engagements regarding potential business
      collaborations and partnerships.\\n\\n## Definition of Confidential Information\\n\\nFor
      purposes of this Agreement, \\\"Confidential Information\\\" means any and all
      non-public information, conveyed in all forms, whether in oral, written, electronic,
      or other form or media, whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified
      as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has been or may be disclosed to, accessed by,
      or observed by Receiving Party, which (i) has actual or potential economic value
      by virtue of not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable
      by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure
      or use, or (ii) is subject to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain
      its secrecy and confidentiality.\\n\\nConfidential Information includes, but
      is not limited to, the following categories: (1) business information (business
      plans, strategies, and models), (2) technical information (technical specifications
      and documentation, research and development activities), (3) customer and market
      information (customer lists and contact information, sales histories and patterns),
      (4) personnel and internal information (employee lists and contact information,
      employment agreements and personnel files), (5) intellectual property (trade
      secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications, copyrights and copyright
      applications, trademarks and trademark applications), (6) strategic information
      (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses and strategies). Software
      code shall also be included into the confidential information.\\n\\nConfidential
      Information shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally
      available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Receiving Party
      or its Representatives; (b) was available to Receiving Party on a non-confidential
      basis prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) becomes available to
      Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a person other than Disclosing
      Party who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality obligation to Disclosing
      Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving Party without reference
      to or use of any Confidential Information. The name of the dog of the Receiving
      Party is Bob.\\n\\nThe designation of information as Confidential Information
      shall not be determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret
      under applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive
      property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license
      or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided
      herein.\\n\\n## Obligations of Receiving Party\\n\\nThe party receiving Confidential
      Information (\\\"Receiving Party\\\") shall:\\n\\n1. Maintain the confidentiality
      of the Confidential Information and not disclose it to any third party without
      the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\\n\\n2. Use the Confidential
      Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging in the potential
      business collaboration.\\n\\n3. Take all necessary precautions to protect the
      confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall be no less than
      the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\\n\\n##
      Exclusions from Confidential Information\\n\\nConfidential Information does
      not include information that:\\n\\n1. Is or becomes publicly known through no
      wrongful act of the Receiving Party.\\n\\n2. Is already known to the Receiving
      Party at the time of disclosure.\\n\\n3. Is lawfully received from a third party
      without breach of this Agreement.\\n\\n4. Is independently developed by the
      Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential
      Information.\\n\\n## Return of Materials\\n\\nUpon termination of this Agreement
      or upon request, the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing Confidential
      Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party's
      discretion.\\n\\n## Liability\\n\\n1. Total Liability Cap:\\n\\nThe total liability
      of either party for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement,
      whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i)
      $100,000 or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing
      Party under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of
      liability is cumulative and not per incident.\\n\\n2. Penalties for Breach:\\n\\nIn
      the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\\n\\n## No License\\n\\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving
      Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential
      Information, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.\\n\\n## Governing
      Law and Disputes\\n\\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
      with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of
      law principles.\\n\\nAll disputes shall be resolved by the courts of the State
      of California. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of five (5)
      years from the date of signing this agreement.\\n\\n## Miscellaneous\\n\\n1.
      This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
      to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral
      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\\n\\n2. Any amendments
      or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both
      parties.\\n\\n3. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable,
      the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision
      shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\\n\\n4.
      The Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\\n\\nIN
      WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement

      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n\\nYour task is to:\\n1.
      Read through the document text provided.\\n    - Note that the document text
      is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as
      headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n2. Identify whether each
      concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n3. For
      each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept.
      The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a
      JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a
      concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n-
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following
      answer format (do not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory
      text).\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two
      keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of
      \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\",
      \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an
      array of objects with mandatory fields \\\"value\\\" and \\\"justification\\\".
      If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the
      array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept is impossible
      to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly
      mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information
      present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted
      items for the concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\".
      Each extracted item's object, even if there is only one, must be part of the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- Item object structure:\\n    -- value:
      Mandatory field holding the extracted item. Must match the exact type specified
      for the concept.\\n        --- If a specific structure is provided for a concept
      under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" the extracted item value must follow that
      structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n        ---
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\" the
      extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n        --- If available labels
      are provided for a concept under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item
      value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none
      of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\\n
      \       --- If there are example items (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"),
      the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\\n        ---
      When extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\\n    -- justification: Mandatory field holding
      a justification of why the item was extracted for the concept. Ensure the justification
      is specific and directly ties the extracted item to the concept's defining features.
      Never reference the concept's ID or any of the structural IDs provided in this
      prompt (such as paragraph IDs like \\\"P0\\\", or sentence IDs like \\\"P0-S0\\\")
      in the justification.\\n        --- Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight
      only the essential details.\\n        --- Justification should be no longer
      than 2 sentences.\\n        --- Justification should be in English.\\n\\n- Types
      of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item type\\\"
      (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure that the value of
      each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type. Python
      types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point
      number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation
      will result in invalid output.\\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or
      modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling missing or multiple items:\\n
      \   -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still contain
      an entry for that concept with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    --
      For boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully
      between these cases:\\n        --- Extract True if the concept is confirmed
      or strongly supported by the provided content (either explicitly stated or reasonably
      inferred)\\n        --- Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied,
      or if the provided content allows you to determine that the concept is not true
      (e.g., absence of expected content that should be present if the concept were
      true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\" empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided content is completely
      irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content does not contain enough
      information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n    -- For concepts that
      have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if none of the predefined labels
      apply to the content, leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty.\\n    --
      For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if multiple labels
      apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g., {\\\"labels\\\":
      [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if
      there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if
      multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within
      the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n    -- Do not

      of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information that may be disclosed
      between the parties during discussions and engagements regarding potential business
      collaborations and partnerships.\\n\\n## Definition of Confidential Information\\n\\nFor
      purposes of this Agreement, \\\"Confidential Information\\\" means any and all
      non-public information, conveyed in all forms, whether in oral, written, electronic,
      or other form or media, whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified
      as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has been or may be disclosed to, accessed by,
      or observed by Receiving Party, which (i) has actual or potential economic value
      by virtue of not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable
      by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure
      or use, or (ii) is subject to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain
      its secrecy and confidentiality.\\n\\nConfidential Information includes, but
      is not limited to, the following categories: (1) business information (business
      plans, strategies, and models), (2) technical information (technical specifications
      and documentation, research and development activities), (3) customer and market
      information (customer lists and contact information, sales histories and patterns),
      (4) personnel and internal information (employee lists and contact information,
      employment agreements and personnel files), (5) intellectual property (trade
      secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications, copyrights and copyright
      applications, trademarks and trademark applications), (6) strategic information
      (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses and strategies). Software
      code shall also be included into the confidential information.\\n\\nConfidential
      Information shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally
      available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Receiving Party
      or its Representatives; (b) was available to Receiving Party on a non-confidential
      basis prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) becomes available to
      Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a person other than Disclosing
      Party who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality obligation to Disclosing
      Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving Party without reference
      to or use of any Confidential Information. The name of the dog of the Receiving
      Party is Bob.\\n\\nThe designation of information as Confidential Information
      shall not be determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret
      under applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive
      property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license
      or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided
      herein.\\n\\n## Obligations of Receiving Party\\n\\nThe party receiving Confidential
      Information (\\\"Receiving Party\\\") shall:\\n\\n1. Maintain the confidentiality
      of the Confidential Information and not disclose it to any third party without
      the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\\n\\n2. Use the Confidential
      Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging in the potential
      business collaboration.\\n\\n3. Take all necessary precautions to protect the
      confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall be no less than
      the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\\n\\n##
      Exclusions from Confidential Information\\n\\nConfidential Information does
      not include information that:\\n\\n1. Is or becomes publicly known through no
      wrongful act of the Receiving Party.\\n\\n2. Is already known to the Receiving
      Party at the time of disclosure.\\n\\n3. Is lawfully received from a third party
      without breach of this Agreement.\\n\\n4. Is independently developed by the
      Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential
      Information.\\n\\n## Return of Materials\\n\\nUpon termination of this Agreement
      or upon request, the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing Confidential
      Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party's
      discretion.\\n\\n## Liability\\n\\n1. Total Liability Cap:\\n\\nThe total liability
      of either party for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement,
      whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i)
      $100,000 or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing
      Party under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of
      liability is cumulative and not per incident.\\n\\n2. Penalties for Breach:\\n\\nIn
      the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\\n\\n## No License\\n\\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving
      Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential
      Information, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.\\n\\n## Governing
      Law and Disputes\\n\\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
      with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of
      law principles.\\n\\nAll disputes shall be resolved by the courts of the State
      of California. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of five (5)
      years from the date of signing this agreement.\\n\\n## Miscellaneous\\n\\n1.
      This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
      to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral
      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\\n\\n2. Any amendments
      or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both
      parties.\\n\\n3. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable,
      the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision
      shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\\n\\n4.
      The Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\\n\\nIN
      WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement

      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints,
      photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\n-
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger
      document and should be analyzed within their limited context. When working with
      fragments, focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain textual or
      visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can be directly
      read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints,
      tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --
      The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\n  -- The expected output
      format and structure requirements\n  -- Any constraints or special handling
      instructions\n\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n  -- All
      extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n  --
      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --
      Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field
      names\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code
      blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n-
      Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the
      task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions,
      include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when
      required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or
      noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References (when required):
      When required by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted
      data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering
      to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across
      diverse document analysis tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"Below you will
      find document text and a list of concepts.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Read through
      the document text provided.\n    - Note that the document text is provided in
      markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings, links,
      lists, and other markdown syntax.\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts
      list is addressed within the document text.\n3. For each concept that appears,
      extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure
      are specified for each concept.\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\n\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      text, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" list. However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item

      for the concept is specified under \"Amount of extracted items\". Each extracted
      item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n-
      Item structure:\n    -- All extracted items must match the exact type specified

      concept specifies an \"extracted item type\" (found under \"Concept extracted
      item type\"). Ensure your extracted items strictly match that type. Python types
      are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point
      number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation
      will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or
      modify the specified structure.\n\n- Handling missing or multiple items:\n    --
      If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still contain an entry

      concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between
      these cases:\n        --- Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly

      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g.,

      the content (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        ---
      Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is
      specified under \"Amount of extracted items\". Each extracted item''s object,
      even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n        ---
      The value of \"reference_paragraphs\" must be an array of objects with mandatory
      fields \"reference_paragraph_id\", which holds the provided ID of the reference
      paragraph, and \"reference_sentence_ids\", which holds the provided IDs of the
      reference sentences within the paragraph. Note that not every sentence in the
      paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant reference.\n\n- Item object structure:\n    --
      value: Mandatory field holding the extracted item. Must match the exact type
      specified for the concept.\n        --- If a specific structure is provided
      for a concept under \"Expected structure,\" the extracted item value must follow
      that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\n        ---
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \"Rating scale,\" the extracted
      item value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept under \"Available labels,\" the extracted item value must be a
      list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none of the predefined
      labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\n        --- If there
      are example items (\"Extracted concept examples\"), the extracted item value
      should follow the same style and formatting.\n        --- When extracting string
      values, translate them in English if the original language of the document is
      not English.\n    -- justification: Mandatory field holding a justification
      of why the item was extracted for the concept. Ensure the justification is specific
      and directly ties the extracted item to the concept''s defining features. Never
      reference the concept''s ID or any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt
      (such as paragraph IDs like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\") in the justification.\n        ---
      Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential details.\n        ---
      Justification should be no longer than 2 sentences.\n        --- Justification
      should be in English.\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects for
      each paragraph based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each object
      should include:\n        --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field holding
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match exactly
      the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.).\n        ---
      reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array of the provided IDs
      of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the item was extracted
      for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the provided ID for the
      sentence (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\", etc.).\n\n- Types of extracted
      items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item type\" (found under
      \"Concept extracted item type\"). Ensure that the value of each of the extracted
      items for the concept strictly matches that type. Python types are provided
      (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict
      for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result
      in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified
      structure.\n\n- Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is
      not mentioned at all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept
      with an empty \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with
      extracted item type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        ---
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if none of the predefined
      labels apply to the content, leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty.\n    --
      For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if multiple labels
      apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have an \"Available labels:\" section: if multiple items are found
      for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n\n- No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations,

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below

      of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information that may be disclosed
      between the parties during discussions and engagements regarding potential business
      collaborations and partnerships.\\n\\n## Definition of Confidential Information\\n\\nFor
      purposes of this Agreement, \\\"Confidential Information\\\" means any and all
      non-public information, conveyed in all forms, whether in oral, written, electronic,
      or other form or media, whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified
      as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has been or may be disclosed to, accessed by,
      or observed by Receiving Party, which (i) has actual or potential economic value
      by virtue of not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable
      by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure
      or use, or (ii) is subject to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain
      its secrecy and confidentiality.\\n\\nConfidential Information includes, but
      is not limited to, the following categories: (1) business information (business
      plans, strategies, and models), (2) technical information (technical specifications
      and documentation, research and development activities), (3) customer and market
      information (customer lists and contact information, sales histories and patterns),
      (4) personnel and internal information (employee lists and contact information,
      employment agreements and personnel files), (5) intellectual property (trade
      secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications, copyrights and copyright
      applications, trademarks and trademark applications), (6) strategic information
      (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses and strategies). Software
      code shall also be included into the confidential information.\\n\\nConfidential
      Information shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally
      available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Receiving Party
      or its Representatives; (b) was available to Receiving Party on a non-confidential
      basis prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) becomes available to
      Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a person other than Disclosing
      Party who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality obligation to Disclosing
      Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving Party without reference
      to or use of any Confidential Information. The name of the dog of the Receiving
      Party is Bob.\\n\\nThe designation of information as Confidential Information
      shall not be determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret
      under applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive
      property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license
      or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided
      herein.\\n\\n## Obligations of Receiving Party\\n\\nThe party receiving Confidential
      Information (\\\"Receiving Party\\\") shall:\\n\\n1. Maintain the confidentiality
      of the Confidential Information and not disclose it to any third party without
      the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\\n\\n2. Use the Confidential
      Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging in the potential
      business collaboration.\\n\\n3. Take all necessary precautions to protect the
      confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall be no less than
      the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\\n\\n##
      Exclusions from Confidential Information\\n\\nConfidential Information does
      not include information that:\\n\\n1. Is or becomes publicly known through no
      wrongful act of the Receiving Party.\\n\\n2. Is already known to the Receiving
      Party at the time of disclosure.\\n\\n3. Is lawfully received from a third party
      without breach of this Agreement.\\n\\n4. Is independently developed by the
      Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential
      Information.\\n\\n## Return of Materials\\n\\nUpon termination of this Agreement
      or upon request, the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing Confidential
      Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party's
      discretion.\\n\\n## Liability\\n\\n1. Total Liability Cap:\\n\\nThe total liability
      of either party for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement,
      whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i)
      $100,000 or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing
      Party under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of
      liability is cumulative and not per incident.\\n\\n2. Penalties for Breach:\\n\\nIn
      the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\\n\\n## No License\\n\\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving
      Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential
      Information, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.\\n\\n## Governing
      Law and Disputes\\n\\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
      with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of
      law principles.\\n\\nAll disputes shall be resolved by the courts of the State
      of California. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of five (5)
      years from the date of signing this agreement.\\n\\n## Miscellaneous\\n\\n1.
      This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
      to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral
      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\\n\\n2. Any amendments
      or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both
      parties.\\n\\n3. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable,
      the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision
      shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\\n\\n4.
      The Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\\n\\nIN
      WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement
      as of the date first above written.\\n\\n_____\\n\\nBy: ___________________________\\n\\nName:

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects. Your task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n-
      Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\",
      etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes,
      topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine
      each paragraph\\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example,
      \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\\n-
      When available, additional context information for paragraphs (such as formatting,
      list context, or table position) will be provided under \\\"Additional information
      about the paragraph:\\\" sections, which provides important context for understanding
      their structural role and position within the document. Use this information
      to:\\n    -- Understand document hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section
      boundaries)\\n    -- Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list items
      are related, table cells contain associated data)\\n    -- Assess content significance
      (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)\\n- Note that paragraphs are provided
      in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings,
      links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n- Note that paragraphs are listed
      in the same order they appear in the original document; therefore, context from
      surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular paragraph is relevant
      to an aspect.\\n- You may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      that paragraph's ID under the aspect's list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph
      does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4.
      Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be
      a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For
      each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The
      aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array
      of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary,
      code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse
      the following answer format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects. Your task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n-
      Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\",
      etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes,
      topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine
      each paragraph\\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example,
      \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\\n-
      When available, additional context information for paragraphs (such as formatting,
      list context, or table position) will be provided under \\\"Additional information
      about the paragraph:\\\" sections, which provides important context for understanding
      their structural role and position within the document. Use this information
      to:\\n    -- Understand document hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section
      boundaries)\\n    -- Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list items
      are related, table cells contain associated data)\\n    -- Assess content significance
      (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)\\n- Note that paragraphs are provided
      in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings,
      links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n- Note that paragraphs are listed
      in the same order they appear in the original document; therefore, context from
      surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular paragraph is relevant
      to an aspect.\\n- You may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      the paragraph's ID and provide a justification, detailing why the paragraph
      is relevant to the aspect.\\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect,
      do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final answer
      in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects,
      each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For each aspect (in the order
      they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier,
      e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph
      that addresses or relates to the aspect. Each object should include:\\n        ---
      paragraph_id: The provided paragraph ID, e.g., \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\".\\n        ---
      justification: A justification of why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect.
      Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the content of the paragraph
      to the aspect's defining features. Never reference any of the structural IDs
      provided in this prompt (such as aspect IDs like \\\"A0\\\", or paragraph IDs
      like \\\"P0\\\") in the justification.\\n            ---- Justification should
      be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential details.\\n            ---- Justification
      should be no longer than 2 sentences.\\n            ---- Justification should
      be in English.\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraphs array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary, code
      block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse the following
      answer format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding text
      or ```json delimiters should be included).\\n\\n======\\nANSWER FORMAT (MANDATORY):\\n[\\n

      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file containing
      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints,
      photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\n-
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger
      document and should be analyzed within their limited context. When working with
      fragments, focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain textual or
      visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can be directly
      read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints,
      tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --
      The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\n  -- The expected output
      format and structure requirements\n  -- Any constraints or special handling
      instructions\n\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n  -- All
      extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n  --
      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --
      Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field
      names\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code
      blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n-
      Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the
      task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions,
      include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when
      required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or
      noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References (when required):
      When required by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted
      data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering
      to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across
      diverse document analysis tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"Below you will
      find document text and a list of concepts.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Read through
      the document text provided.\n    - Note that the document text is provided in
      markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings, links,
      lists, and other markdown syntax.\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts
      list is addressed within the document text.\n3. For each concept that appears,
      extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure
      are specified for each concept.\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\n\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      text, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" list. However, for boolean concepts (with extracted item
      type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n- Extract True if the concept is confirmed
      or strongly supported by the document content (either explicitly stated or reasonably
      inferred)\n- Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the
      document content allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g.,
      absence of expected content that should be present if the concept were true)\n-
      Only leave \"extracted_items\" empty if the concept is impossible to determine
      because either: (1) the document is completely irrelevant to the concept, or
      (2) the document does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about
      the concept\n\nFollow these additional rules:\n\n- Output format:\nProvide your
      answer in only the following answer format (do not include backticks, code fences,
      or any introductory/explanatory text).\n\n- Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object
      in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\" and \"extracted_items\".\n    --
      The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value of \"extracted_items\" must be an array.
      If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the
      array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept is impossible
      to determine.\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly
      mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information
      present).\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items
      for the concept is specified under \"Amount of extracted items\". Each extracted
      item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n-
      Item structure:\n    -- All extracted items must match the exact type specified
      for the concept.\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for a concept under
      \"Expected structure,\" you must follow that structure for all extracted items
      corresponding to that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept
      under \"Rating scale,\" the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    --
      If available labels are provided for a concept under \"Available labels,\" the
      extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined
      set. If none of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that
      concept.\n    -- If there are example items (\"Extracted concept examples\"),
      try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n    --
      When extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\n\n- Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each
      concept specifies an \"extracted item type\" (found under \"Concept extracted
      item type\"). Ensure your extracted items strictly match that type. Python types
      are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point
      number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation
      will result in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or
      modify the specified structure.\n\n- Handling missing or multiple items:\n    --
      If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still contain an entry
      for that concept with an empty \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean
      concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between
      these cases:\n        --- Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly
      supported by the provided content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        ---
      Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content
      allows you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected
      content that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave
      \"extracted_items\" empty if the concept is impossible to determine because
      either: (1) the provided content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or
      (2) the provided content does not contain enough information to make a conclusion
      about the concept\n    -- For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section:
      if none of the predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \"extracted_items\"
      array empty.\n    -- For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g.,
      {\"labels\": [\"label1\", \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items
      if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\n    -- For concepts that do not have an \"Available labels:\"
      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n- No additional text:\n    --
      Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON array.\n    --
      Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other formatting characters.\n\n======\nANSWER

      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --
      The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\n  -- The expected output
      format and structure requirements\n  -- Any constraints or special handling
      instructions\n\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n  -- All
      extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n  --
      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --
      Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field
      names\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code
      blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n-
      Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the
      task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions,
      include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when
      required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or
      noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References (when required):
      When required by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted
      data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering
      to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across
      diverse document analysis tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"Below you will
      find a list of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list of concepts.\n\nYour
      task is to:\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\n    -
      Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\",
      etc.).\n    - Each paragraph includes sentences, each identified by a sentence
      ID (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S1\", etc.), followed by the full text of the
      sentence.\n    - When available, additional context information for paragraphs
      and sentences (such as formatting, list context, or table position) will be
      provided under \"Additional information about the paragraph:\" and \"Additional
      information about the sentence:\" sections, which provides important context
      for understanding their structural role and position within the document. Use
      this information to:\n        -- Understand document hierarchy (e.g., headings
      indicate section boundaries)\n        -- Recognize relationships between content
      (e.g., list items are related, table cells contain associated data)\n        --
      Assess content significance (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)\n    -
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document.\n    - You may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n2. Identify whether each concept in
      the concepts list is addressed within the document paragraphs.\n3. For each
      concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The
      item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4. Produce a JSON
      array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n\nIf a concept
      is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \"bool\"), distinguish carefully:\n-
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n- Extract False if
      the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you to
      determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content that
      should be present if the concept were true)\n- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n\nFollow these additional
      rules:\n\n- Output format:\nProvide your answer in only the following answer
      format (do not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory
      text).\n\n- Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two
      keys: \"concept_id\" and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\"
      must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    --
      The value of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory
      fields \"value\", \"justification\", and \"reference_paragraphs\". If the concept
      is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).
      For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept is impossible to determine.\n        ---
      Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from
      the content (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        ---
      Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is
      specified under \"Amount of extracted items\". Each extracted item''s object,
      even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n        ---
      The value of \"reference_paragraphs\" must be an array of objects with mandatory
      fields \"reference_paragraph_id\", which holds the provided ID of the reference
      paragraph, and \"reference_sentence_ids\", which holds the provided IDs of the
      reference sentences within the paragraph. Note that not every sentence in the
      paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant reference.\n\n- Item object structure:\n    --
      value: Mandatory field holding the extracted item. Must match the exact type
      specified for the concept.\n        --- If a specific structure is provided
      for a concept under \"Expected structure,\" the extracted item value must follow
      that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\n        ---
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \"Rating scale,\" the extracted
      item value must be within that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided
      for a concept under \"Available labels,\" the extracted item value must be a
      list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none of the predefined
      labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\n        --- If there
      are example items (\"Extracted concept examples\"), the extracted item value
      should follow the same style and formatting.\n        --- When extracting string
      values, translate them in English if the original language of the document is
      not English.\n    -- justification: Mandatory field holding a justification
      of why the item was extracted for the concept. Ensure the justification is specific
      and directly ties the extracted item to the concept''s defining features. Never
      reference the concept''s ID or any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt
      (such as paragraph IDs like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\") in the justification.\n        ---
      Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential details.\n        ---
      Justification should be no longer than 2 sentences.\n        --- Justification
      should be in English.\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects for
      each paragraph based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each object
      should include:\n        --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field holding
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match exactly
      the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.).\n        ---
      reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array of the provided IDs
      of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the item was extracted
      for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the provided ID for the
      sentence (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\", etc.).\n\n- Types of extracted
      items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item type\" (found under
      \"Concept extracted item type\"). Ensure that the value of each of the extracted
      items for the concept strictly matches that type. Python types are provided
      (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict
      for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation will result
      in invalid output.\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified
      structure.\n\n- Handling missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is
      not mentioned at all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept
      with an empty \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For boolean concepts (with
      extracted item type \"bool\"): Distinguish carefully between these cases:\n        ---
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the provided
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\n        --- Extract
      False if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the provided content allows
      you to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\n        --- Only leave \"extracted_items\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided
      content is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content
      does not contain enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\n    --
      For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if none of the predefined
      labels apply to the content, leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty.\n    --
      For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if multiple labels
      apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have an \"Available labels:\" section: if multiple items are found
      for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n\n- No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations,
      or text outside of the JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in
      backticks or any other formatting characters.\n\n======\nANSWER FORMAT (MANDATORY):\n[\n    {\n        \"concept_id\":

    body: '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You will be assigned tasks involving
      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file containing
      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints,
      photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\n-
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger
      document and should be analyzed within their limited context. When working with
      fragments, focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain textual or
      visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can be directly
      read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints,
      tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --
      The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\n  -- The expected output
      format and structure requirements\n  -- Any constraints or special handling
      instructions\n\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n  -- All
      extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n  --
      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and

      of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information that may be disclosed
      between the parties during discussions and engagements regarding potential business
      collaborations and partnerships.\\n\\n## Definition of Confidential Information\\n\\nFor
      purposes of this Agreement, \\\"Confidential Information\\\" means any and all
      non-public information, conveyed in all forms, whether in oral, written, electronic,
      or other form or media, whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified
      as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has been or may be disclosed to, accessed by,
      or observed by Receiving Party, which (i) has actual or potential economic value
      by virtue of not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable
      by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure
      or use, or (ii) is subject to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain
      its secrecy and confidentiality.\\n\\nConfidential Information includes, but
      is not limited to, the following categories: (1) business information (business
      plans, strategies, and models), (2) technical information (technical specifications
      and documentation, research and development activities), (3) customer and market
      information (customer lists and contact information, sales histories and patterns),
      (4) personnel and internal information (employee lists and contact information,
      employment agreements and personnel files), (5) intellectual property (trade
      secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications, copyrights and copyright
      applications, trademarks and trademark applications), (6) strategic information
      (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses and strategies). Software
      code shall also be included into the confidential information.\\n\\nConfidential
      Information shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally
      available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Receiving Party
      or its Representatives; (b) was available to Receiving Party on a non-confidential
      basis prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) becomes available to
      Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a person other than Disclosing
      Party who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality obligation to Disclosing
      Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving Party without reference
      to or use of any Confidential Information. The name of the dog of the Receiving
      Party is Bob.\\n\\nThe designation of information as Confidential Information
      shall not be determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret
      under applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive
      property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license
      or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided
      herein.\\n\\n## Obligations of Receiving Party\\n\\nThe party receiving Confidential
      Information (\\\"Receiving Party\\\") shall:\\n\\n1. Maintain the confidentiality
      of the Confidential Information and not disclose it to any third party without
      the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\\n\\n2. Use the Confidential
      Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging in the potential
      business collaboration.\\n\\n3. Take all necessary precautions to protect the
      confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall be no less than
      the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\\n\\n##
      Exclusions from Confidential Information\\n\\nConfidential Information does
      not include information that:\\n\\n1. Is or becomes publicly known through no
      wrongful act of the Receiving Party.\\n\\n2. Is already known to the Receiving
      Party at the time of disclosure.\\n\\n3. Is lawfully received from a third party
      without breach of this Agreement.\\n\\n4. Is independently developed by the
      Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential
      Information.\\n\\n## Return of Materials\\n\\nUpon termination of this Agreement
      or upon request, the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing Confidential
      Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party's
      discretion.\\n\\n## Liability\\n\\n1. Total Liability Cap:\\n\\nThe total liability
      of either party for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement,
      whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i)
      $100,000 or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing
      Party under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of
      liability is cumulative and not per incident.\\n\\n2. Penalties for Breach:\\n\\nIn
      the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\\n\\n## No License\\n\\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving
      Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential
      Information, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.\\n\\n## Governing
      Law and Disputes\\n\\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
      with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of
      law principles.\\n\\nAll disputes shall be resolved by the courts of the State
      of California. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of five (5)
      years from the date of signing this agreement.\\n\\n## Miscellaneous\\n\\n1.
      This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
      to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral
      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\\n\\n2. Any amendments
      or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both
      parties.\\n\\n3. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable,
      the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision
      shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\\n\\n4.
      The Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\\n\\nIN
      WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement
      as of the date first above written.\\n\\n_____\\n\\nBy: ___________________________\\n\\nName:

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n\\nYour task is to:\\n1.
      Read through the document text provided.\\n    - Note that the document text
      is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as
      headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n2. Identify whether each
      concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n3. For
      each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept.
      The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a
      JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a
      concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n-
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following
      answer format (do not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory
      text).\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two
      keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of
      \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\",
      \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an
      array of objects with mandatory fields \\\"value\\\" and \\\"justification\\\".
      If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the
      array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept is impossible
      to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly
      mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information
      present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted
      items for the concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\".
      Each extracted item's object, even if there is only one, must be part of the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- Item object structure:\\n    -- value:
      Mandatory field holding the extracted item. Must match the exact type specified
      for the concept.\\n        --- If a specific structure is provided for a concept
      under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" the extracted item value must follow that
      structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n        ---
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\" the
      extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n        --- If available labels
      are provided for a concept under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item
      value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none
      of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\\n
      \       --- If there are example items (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"),
      the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\\n        ---
      When extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\\n    -- justification: Mandatory field holding
      a justification of why the item was extracted for the concept. Ensure the justification
      is specific and directly ties the extracted item to the concept's defining features.
      Never reference the concept's ID or any of the structural IDs provided in this
      prompt (such as paragraph IDs like \\\"P0\\\", or sentence IDs like \\\"P0-S0\\\")
      in the justification.\\n        --- Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight
      only the essential details.\\n        --- Justification should be no longer
      than 2 sentences.\\n        --- Justification should be in English.\\n\\n- Types
      of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item type\\\"
      (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure that the value of
      each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type. Python
      types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point
      number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation
      will result in invalid output.\\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or
      modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling missing or multiple items:\\n
      \   -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still contain
      an entry for that concept with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    --
      For boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully
      between these cases:\\n        --- Extract True if the concept is confirmed
      or strongly supported by the provided content (either explicitly stated or reasonably
      inferred)\\n        --- Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied,
      or if the provided content allows you to determine that the concept is not true
      (e.g., absence of expected content that should be present if the concept were
      true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\" empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided content is completely
      irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content does not contain enough
      information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n    -- For concepts that
      have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if none of the predefined labels
      apply to the content, leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty.\\n    --
      For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if multiple labels
      apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g., {\\\"labels\\\":
      [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if
      there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if
      multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within
      the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n    -- Do not

      of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information that may be disclosed
      between the parties during discussions and engagements regarding potential business
      collaborations and partnerships.\\n\\n## Definition of Confidential Information\\n\\nFor
      purposes of this Agreement, \\\"Confidential Information\\\" means any and all
      non-public information, conveyed in all forms, whether in oral, written, electronic,
      or other form or media, whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified
      as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has been or may be disclosed to, accessed by,
      or observed by Receiving Party, which (i) has actual or potential economic value
      by virtue of not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable
      by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure
      or use, or (ii) is subject to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain
      its secrecy and confidentiality.\\n\\nConfidential Information includes, but
      is not limited to, the following categories: (1) business information (business
      plans, strategies, and models), (2) technical information (technical specifications
      and documentation, research and development activities), (3) customer and market
      information (customer lists and contact information, sales histories and patterns),
      (4) personnel and internal information (employee lists and contact information,
      employment agreements and personnel files), (5) intellectual property (trade
      secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications, copyrights and copyright
      applications, trademarks and trademark applications), (6) strategic information
      (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses and strategies). Software
      code shall also be included into the confidential information.\\n\\nConfidential
      Information shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally
      available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Receiving Party
      or its Representatives; (b) was available to Receiving Party on a non-confidential
      basis prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) becomes available to
      Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a person other than Disclosing
      Party who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality obligation to Disclosing
      Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving Party without reference
      to or use of any Confidential Information. The name of the dog of the Receiving
      Party is Bob.\\n\\nThe designation of information as Confidential Information
      shall not be determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret
      under applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive
      property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license
      or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided
      herein.\\n\\n## Obligations of Receiving Party\\n\\nThe party receiving Confidential
      Information (\\\"Receiving Party\\\") shall:\\n\\n1. Maintain the confidentiality
      of the Confidential Information and not disclose it to any third party without
      the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\\n\\n2. Use the Confidential
      Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging in the potential
      business collaboration.\\n\\n3. Take all necessary precautions to protect the
      confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall be no less than
      the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\\n\\n##
      Exclusions from Confidential Information\\n\\nConfidential Information does
      not include information that:\\n\\n1. Is or becomes publicly known through no
      wrongful act of the Receiving Party.\\n\\n2. Is already known to the Receiving
      Party at the time of disclosure.\\n\\n3. Is lawfully received from a third party
      without breach of this Agreement.\\n\\n4. Is independently developed by the
      Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential
      Information.\\n\\n## Return of Materials\\n\\nUpon termination of this Agreement
      or upon request, the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing Confidential
      Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party's
      discretion.\\n\\n## Liability\\n\\n1. Total Liability Cap:\\n\\nThe total liability
      of either party for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement,
      whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i)
      $100,000 or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing
      Party under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of
      liability is cumulative and not per incident.\\n\\n2. Penalties for Breach:\\n\\nIn
      the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\\n\\n## No License\\n\\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving
      Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential
      Information, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.\\n\\n## Governing
      Law and Disputes\\n\\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
      with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of
      law principles.\\n\\nAll disputes shall be resolved by the courts of the State
      of California. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of five (5)
      years from the date of signing this agreement.\\n\\n## Miscellaneous\\n\\n1.
      This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
      to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral
      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\\n\\n2. Any amendments
      or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both
      parties.\\n\\n3. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable,
      the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision
      shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\\n\\n4.
      The Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\\n\\nIN
      WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement
      as of the date first above written.\\n\\n_____\\n\\nBy: ___________________________\\n\\nName:

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects. Your task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n-
      Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\",
      etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes,
      topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine
      each paragraph\\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example,
      \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\\n-
      When available, additional context information for paragraphs (such as formatting,
      list context, or table position) will be provided under \\\"Additional information
      about the paragraph:\\\" sections, which provides important context for understanding
      their structural role and position within the document. Use this information
      to:\\n    -- Understand document hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section
      boundaries)\\n    -- Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list items
      are related, table cells contain associated data)\\n    -- Assess content significance
      (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)\\n- Note that paragraphs are provided
      in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings,
      links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n- Note that paragraphs are listed
      in the same order they appear in the original document; therefore, context from
      surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular paragraph is relevant
      to an aspect.\\n- You may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      that paragraph's ID under the aspect's list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph
      does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4.
      Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be
      a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For
      each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The
      aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array
      of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary,
      code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n\\nYour task is to:\\n1.
      Read through the document text provided.\\n    - Note that the document text
      is provided in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as
      headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n2. Identify whether each
      concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n3. For
      each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept.
      The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a
      JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a
      concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list. However,
      for boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"), distinguish carefully:\\n-
      Extract True if the concept is confirmed or strongly supported by the document
      content (either explicitly stated or reasonably inferred)\\n- Extract False
      if the concept is contradicted, denied, or if the document content allows you
      to determine that the concept is not true (e.g., absence of expected content
      that should be present if the concept were true)\\n- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      empty if the concept is impossible to determine because either: (1) the document
      is completely irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the document does not contain
      enough information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following
      answer format (do not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory
      text).\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two
      keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of
      \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\",
      \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an
      array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave
      the array empty ([]). For boolean concepts, only leave empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine.\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly
      (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from
      the information present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount
      of extracted items for the concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted
      items\\\". Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- Item structure:\\n    -- All extracted
      items must match the exact type specified for the concept.\\n    -- If a specific
      structure is provided for a concept under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" you must
      follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n
      \   -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\"
      the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available labels
      are provided for a concept under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item
      value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none
      of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\\n
      \   -- If there are example items (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"), try
      to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\\n    -- When
      extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\\n\\n- Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each
      concept specifies an \\\"extracted item type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted
      item type\\\"). Ensure your extracted items strictly match that type. Python
      types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point
      number, dict for object, etc.). Type compliance is mandatory - any deviation
      will result in invalid output.\\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or
      modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling missing or multiple items:\\n
      \   -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still contain
      an entry for that concept with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    --
      For boolean concepts (with extracted item type \\\"bool\\\"): Distinguish carefully
      between these cases:\\n        --- Extract True if the concept is confirmed
      or strongly supported by the provided content (either explicitly stated or reasonably
      inferred)\\n        --- Extract False if the concept is contradicted, denied,
      or if the provided content allows you to determine that the concept is not true
      (e.g., absence of expected content that should be present if the concept were
      true)\\n        --- Only leave \\\"extracted_items\\\" empty if the concept
      is impossible to determine because either: (1) the provided content is completely
      irrelevant to the concept, or (2) the provided content does not contain enough
      information to make a conclusion about the concept\\n    -- For concepts that
      have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if none of the predefined labels
      apply to the content, leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty.\\n    --
      For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if multiple labels
      apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g., {\\\"labels\\\":
      [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if
      there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if
      multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry within
      the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n    -- Do not
      include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON array.\\n    --

      (012) 345-6789\\n\\nEmail: jane.doe@example.com\\n\\n## Purpose\\n\\nThe purpose
      of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information that may be disclosed
      between the parties during discussions and engagements regarding potential business
      collaborations and partnerships.\\n\\n## Definition of Confidential Information\\n\\nFor
      purposes of this Agreement, \\\"Confidential Information\\\" means any and all
      non-public information, conveyed in all forms, whether in oral, written, electronic,
      or other form or media, whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified
      as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has been or may be disclosed to, accessed by,
      or observed by Receiving Party, which (i) has actual or potential economic value
      by virtue of not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable
      by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure
      or use, or (ii) is subject to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain
      its secrecy and confidentiality.\\n\\nConfidential Information includes, but
      is not limited to, the following categories: (1) business information (business
      plans, strategies, and models), (2) technical information (technical specifications
      and documentation, research and development activities), (3) customer and market
      information (customer lists and contact information, sales histories and patterns),
      (4) personnel and internal information (employee lists and contact information,
      employment agreements and personnel files), (5) intellectual property (trade
      secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications, copyrights and copyright
      applications, trademarks and trademark applications), (6) strategic information
      (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses and strategies). Software
      code shall also be included into the confidential information.\\n\\nConfidential
      Information shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally
      available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Receiving Party
      or its Representatives; (b) was available to Receiving Party on a non-confidential
      basis prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) becomes available to
      Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a person other than Disclosing
      Party who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality obligation to Disclosing
      Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving Party without reference
      to or use of any Confidential Information. The name of the dog of the Receiving
      Party is Bob.\\n\\nThe designation of information as Confidential Information
      shall not be determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret
      under applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive
      property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license
      or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided
      herein.\\n\\n## Obligations of Receiving Party\\n\\nThe party receiving Confidential
      Information (\\\"Receiving Party\\\") shall:\\n\\n1. Maintain the confidentiality
      of the Confidential Information and not disclose it to any third party without
      the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\\n\\n2. Use the Confidential
      Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging in the potential
      business collaboration.\\n\\n3. Take all necessary precautions to protect the
      confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall be no less than
      the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\\n\\n##
      Exclusions from Confidential Information\\n\\nConfidential Information does
      not include information that:\\n\\n1. Is or becomes publicly known through no
      wrongful act of the Receiving Party.\\n\\n2. Is already known to the Receiving
      Party at the time of disclosure.\\n\\n3. Is lawfully received from a third party
      without breach of this Agreement.\\n\\n4. Is independently developed by the
      Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential
      Information.\\n\\n## Return of Materials\\n\\nUpon termination of this Agreement
      or upon request, the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing Confidential
      Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party's
      discretion.\\n\\n## Liability\\n\\n1. Total Liability Cap:\\n\\nThe total liability
      of either party for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement,
      whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i)
      $100,000 or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing
      Party under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of
      liability is cumulative and not per incident.\\n\\n2. Penalties for Breach:\\n\\nIn
      the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\\n\\n## No License\\n\\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving
      Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential
      Information, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.\\n\\n## Governing
      Law and Disputes\\n\\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
      with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of
      law principles.\\n\\nAll disputes shall be resolved by the courts of the State
      of California. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of five (5)
      years from the date of signing this agreement.\\n\\n## Miscellaneous\\n\\n1.
      This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
      to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral
      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\\n\\n2. Any amendments
      or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both
      parties.\\n\\n3. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable,
      the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision
      shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\\n\\n4.
      The Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\\n\\nIN
      WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement
