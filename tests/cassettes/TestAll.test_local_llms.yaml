    body: '{"model": "llama3.1:8b", "prompt": "### System:\nYou will be assigned tasks
      involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various
      types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide
      accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional
      experience and qualifications.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n- Understand the context: Before processing
      the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document and the aspects
      or concepts you need to focus on.\n- Follow specific instructions: Each task
      will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts to focus
      on and how the data should be presented.\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide precise
      extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document''s intent
      and context.\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure, language,
      or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations effectively.\n\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\n\n\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality
      performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\n\n### User:\nBelow you
      will find document text and a list of concepts.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Read
      through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether each concept in the
      concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n3. For each concept that
      appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format
      and structure are specified for each concept.\n4. Produce a JSON array containing
      your extracted data, in the provided format.\n\nIf a concept is not addressed
      in the document text, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output
      but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.\n\nFollow these additional rules:\n\n-
      Output format:\nProvide your answer in only the following answer format (do
      not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not found or there
      are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified under \"Amount
      of extracted items\". Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be
      part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n- Item structure:\n    -- If a specific
      structure is provided for a concept under \u201cExpected structure,\u201d you
      must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\n    --
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \"Rating scale,\" the extracted
      item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If there are example items (\u201cExtracted
      concept examples\u201d), try to follow the same style and formatting for your
      extracted items.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n\n- Types of extracted
      items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item type\" (found under
      \"Concept extracted item type\"). Ensure your extracted items strictly match
      that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer,
      float for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\n    -- Do not introduce
      any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n\n- Handling missing or
      multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should
      still contain an entry for that concept with an empty \"extracted_items\" array.\n    --
      If multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry
      within the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n- No additional text:\n    -- Do not
      include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON array.\n    --
      Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other formatting characters.\n\n===\nANSWER
      FORMAT (MANDATORY):\n[\n    {\n        \"concept_id\": str,\n        \"extracted_items:
      [\n            ...\n        ],\n    },\n    ...\n]\n===\n\n___\nCONCEPTS:\n```\n-
      Concept ID: C0\nConcept name: Contract title\n\nConcept description:\nThe title

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional
      experience and qualifications.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n- Understand the context: Before processing
      the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document and the aspects
      or concepts you need to focus on.\n- Follow specific instructions: Each task
      will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts to focus
      on and how the data should be presented.\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide precise
      extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document''s intent
      and context.\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure, language,
      or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations effectively.\n\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\n\n\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality
      performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\n\n### User:\nBelow you
      will find document text and a list of concepts.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Read
      through the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether each concept in the
      concepts list is addressed within the document text.\n3. For each concept that
      appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format
      and structure are specified for each concept.\n4. Produce a JSON array containing
      your extracted data, in the provided format.\n\nIf a concept is not addressed
      in the document text, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output
      but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.\n\nFollow these additional rules:\n\n-
      Output format:\nProvide your answer in only the following answer format (do
      not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\n\n-
      Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\"
      and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly
      the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value
      of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not found or there
      are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified under \"Amount
      of extracted items\". Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be
      part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n- Item structure:\n    -- If a specific
      structure is provided for a concept under \u201cExpected structure,\u201d you
      must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\n    --
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \"Rating scale,\" the extracted
      item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If there are example items (\u201cExtracted
      concept examples\u201d), try to follow the same style and formatting for your
      extracted items.\n    -- When extracting string values, translate them in English
      if the original language of the document is not English.\n\n- Types of extracted
      items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item type\" (found under
      \"Concept extracted item type\"). Ensure your extracted items strictly match
      that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer,
      float for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\n    -- Do not introduce
      any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n\n- Handling missing or
      multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should
      still contain an entry for that concept with an empty \"extracted_items\" array.\n    --
      If multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry
      within the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n- No additional text:\n    -- Do not
      include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON array.\n    --
      Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other formatting characters.\n\n===\nANSWER

        "response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to tackle this task step by step. Let''s
        see what the user is asking for. They provided a document text and a list
        of concepts, specifically one concept in this case: C0 with the name \"Contract
        title\". My job is to determine if this concept is addressed in the document
        and extract any relevant items.\n\nFirst, I''ll read through the document
        text carefully. The text starts with \"Non-disclosure agreement\" followed
        by some clauses about confidentiality. So, the first line seems to be the
        title of the contract.\n\nNow, looking at the concept details: C0 is about
        the contract title, which should be a string. The amount of extracted items
        can be zero, one, or multiple. Since the document starts with \"Non-disclosure
        agreement\", that''s clearly the title here.\n\nI need to make sure I extract
        this correctly. There are no other potential titles mentioned in the text,
        so only one item is needed. Also, since it''s a string, I''ll just take the
        exact wording from the document.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON
        should have an entry for C0 with \"Non-disclosure agreement\" as the extracted
        item.\n</think>\n\n[\n    {\n        \"concept_id\": \"C0\",\n        \"extracted_items\":
