      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n- Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.), includes a name,
      and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that
      might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n- Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph and, optionally, additional
      information about the paragraph, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      that paragraph's ID under the aspect's list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph
      does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4.
      Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be
      a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For
      each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The
      aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array
      of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary,
      code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse
      the following answer format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding
      text or ```json delimiters should be included).\\n\\n===\\nANSWER FORMAT (MANDATORY):\\n[\\n

      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n- Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.), includes a name,
      and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that
      might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n- Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph and, optionally, additional
      information about the paragraph, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      that paragraph's ID under the aspect's list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph
      does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4.
      Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be
      a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For
      each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The
      aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array
      of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary,
      code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse
      the following answer format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding
      text or ```json delimiters should be included).\\n\\n===\\nANSWER FORMAT (MANDATORY):\\n[\\n

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document

      marked, designated, or otherwise identified as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has
      been or may be disclosed to, accessed by, or observed by Receiving Party, which
      (i) has actual or potential economic value by virtue of not being generally
      known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons
      who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, or (ii) is subject
      to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain its secrecy and confidentiality.Confidential

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find document

      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure your extracted
      items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string,
      int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\\n
      \   -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- If multiple items are found for a concept,
      include each as a separate entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n-
      No additional text:\\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text

      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.

      the exclusive property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no
      rights, by license or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except
      as expressly provided herein.a. Maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential
      Information and not disclose it to any third party without the prior written
      consent of the Disclosing Party.b. Use the Confidential Information solely for
      the purpose of evaluating or engaging in the potential business collaboration.c.

      to injunctive relief, the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages
      in the amount of $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use
      of Confidential Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable
      estimate of the damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.Nothing in this

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find document

      int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\\n
      \   -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list of concepts.\\n\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\\n
      \   - Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P1\\\", etc.), optionally followed by additional information about the paragraph,
      which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n    - Each paragraph includes sentences,
      each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the sentence and, optionally, additional
      information about the sentence, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n
      \   - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document.\\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed
      within the document paragraphs.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract
      zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure are
      specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      paragraphs, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with
      an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list.\\n\\nFollow these additional rules:\\n\\n-
      Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following answer format (do
      not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\\n\\n-
      Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\"
      and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match
      exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n
      \   -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an array of objects with
      mandatory fields \\\"value\\\" and \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\". If the concept
      is not found or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\\n
      \       --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items for the
      concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\". Each extracted
      item's object, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n        --- The value of \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\" must be an array
      of objects with mandatory fields \\\"reference_paragraph_id\\\", which holds
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \\\"reference_sentence_ids\\\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\\n\\n- Item object structure:\\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding
      the extracted item.\\n        --- If a specific structure is provided for a
      concept under \u201CExpected structure,\u201D the extracted item value must
      follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n
      \       --- If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\"
      the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n        --- If there are
      example items (\u201CExtracted concept examples\u201D), the extracted item value
      should follow the same style and formatting.\\n        --- When extracting string
      values, translate them in English if the original language of the document is
      not English.\\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph
      based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each object should include:\\n
      \       --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field holding the provided ID
      of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match exactly the provided
      ID for the paragraph (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.).\\n        ---
      reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array of the provided IDs
      of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the item was extracted
      for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the provided ID for the
      sentence (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S2\\\", etc.).\\n\\n- Types of
      extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item type\\\"
      (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure that the value of
      each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type. Python
      types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point
      number, dict for object, etc.).\\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or
      modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling missing or multiple items:\\n
      \   -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still contain
      an entry for that concept with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    --
      If multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry
      within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n    --
      Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON array.\\n

      of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list of concepts.\\n\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\\n
      \   - Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P1\\\", etc.), optionally followed by additional information about the paragraph,
      which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n    - Each paragraph includes sentences,
      each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S1\\\",

      information about the sentence, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n
      \   - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original

      an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list.\\n\\nFollow these additional rules:\\n\\n-
      Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following answer format (do
      not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\\n\\n-
      Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\"
      and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match
      exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n

      the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \\\"reference_sentence_ids\\\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.

      example items (\u201CExtracted concept examples\u201D), the extracted item value
      should follow the same style and formatting.\\n        --- When extracting string
      values, translate them in English if the original language of the document is
      not English.\\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph
      based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each object should include:\\n

      sentence (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S2\\\", etc.).\\n\\n- Types of
      extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item type\\\"
      (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure that the value of
      each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type. Python
      types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations

      this Agreement, \\\"Confidential Information\\\" means any and all non-public
      information, conveyed in all forms, whether in oral, written, electronic, or
      other form or media, whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified
      as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has been or may be disclosed to, accessed by,
      or observed by Receiving Party, which (i) has actual or potential economic value
      by virtue of not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable
      by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure
      or use, or (ii) is subject to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain
      its secrecy and confidentiality.Confidential Information includes, but is not
      limited to, the following categories: (1) business information (business plans,
      strategies, and models), (2) technical information (technical specifications
      and documentation, research and development activities), (3) customer and market
      information (customer lists and contact information, sales histories and patterns),
      (4) personnel and internal information (employee lists and contact information,
      employment agreements and personnel files), (5) intellectual property (trade
      secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications, copyrights and copyright
      applications, trademarks and trademark applications), (6) strategic information
      (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses and strategies). Software
      code shall also be included into the confidential information.Confidential Information
      shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally available to
      the public other than as a result of disclosure by Receiving Party or its Representatives;
      (b) was available to Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis prior to its
      disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) becomes available to Receiving Party on

      any Confidential Information. The name of the dog of the Receiving Party is
      Bob.The designation of information as Confidential Information shall not be
      determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret under applicable
      law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive property of Disclosing
      Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license or otherwise, to
      use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided herein.a. Maintain
      the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and not disclose it to any
      third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.b. Use
      the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging
      in the potential business collaboration.c. Take all necessary precautions to
      protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall be

      destroy them, at the Disclosing Party's discretion.In the event of a breach
      of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled
      to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy available at law or
      in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach of this Agreement
      may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which monetary damages
      would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief, the Receiving
      Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of $25,000 for each
      instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information, which
      the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the damages likely to
      be suffered and not a penalty.Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n- Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.), includes a name,
      and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that
      might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n- Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph and, optionally, additional
      information about the paragraph, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      the paragraph's ID and provide a justification, detailing why the paragraph
      is relevant to the aspect.\\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect,
      do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final answer
      in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects,
      each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For each aspect (in the order
      they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier,
      e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph
      that addresses or relates to the aspect. Each object should include:\\n        ---
      paragraph_id: The provided paragraph ID, e.g., \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\".\\n        ---
      justification: A justification of why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect.
      Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the content of the paragraph
      to the aspect's defining features. Never reference the paragraph's ID in the
      justification.\\n            ---- Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight
      only the essential details.\\n            ---- Justification should be no longer
      than 2 sentences.\\n            ---- Justification should be in English.\\n
      \   -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty
      paragraphs array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers,
      or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse the following answer
      format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding text or ```json

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n- Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.), includes a name,
      and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that
      might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n- Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph and, optionally, additional
      information about the paragraph, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      that paragraph's ID under the aspect's list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph
      does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4.
      Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be
      a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For
      each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The
      aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array
      of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary,
      code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list of concepts.\\n\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\\n
      \   - Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P1\\\", etc.), optionally followed by additional information about the paragraph,
      which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n    - Each paragraph includes sentences,
      each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the sentence and, optionally, additional
      information about the sentence, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n
      \   - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document.\\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed
      within the document paragraphs.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract
      zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure are
      specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      paragraphs, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with
      an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list.\\n\\nFollow these additional rules:\\n\\n-
      Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following answer format (do
      not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\\n\\n-
      Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\"
      and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match
      exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n
      \   -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an array of objects with
      mandatory fields \\\"value\\\" and \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\". If the concept
      is not found or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\\n
      \       --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items for the
      concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\". Each extracted
      item's object, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n        --- The value of \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\" must be an array
      of objects with mandatory fields \\\"reference_paragraph_id\\\", which holds
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \\\"reference_sentence_ids\\\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\\n\\n- Item object structure:\\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding
      the extracted item.\\n        --- If a specific structure is provided for a
      concept under \u201CExpected structure,\u201D the extracted item value must
      follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n
      \       --- If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\"
      the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n        --- If there are
      example items (\u201CExtracted concept examples\u201D), the extracted item value
      should follow the same style and formatting.\\n        --- When extracting string
      values, translate them in English if the original language of the document is
      not English.\\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph
      based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each object should include:\\n
      \       --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field holding the provided ID
      of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match exactly the provided
      ID for the paragraph (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.).\\n        ---
      reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array of the provided IDs
      of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the item was extracted
      for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the provided ID for the
      sentence (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S2\\\", etc.).\\n\\n- Types of
      extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item type\\\"
      (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure that the value of
      each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type. Python
      types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point
      number, dict for object, etc.).\\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or
      modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling missing or multiple items:\\n
      \   -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still contain
      an entry for that concept with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    --
      If multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry
      within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n    --
      Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON array.\\n

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations

      of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information that may be disclosed
      between the parties during discussions and engagements regarding potential business
      collaborations and partnerships.For purposes of this Agreement, \\\"Confidential
      Information\\\" means any and all non-public information, conveyed in all forms,
      whether in oral, written, electronic, or other form or media, whether or not
      marked, designated, or otherwise identified as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has
      been or may be disclosed to, accessed by, or observed by Receiving Party, which
      (i) has actual or potential economic value by virtue of not being generally
      known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons
      who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, or (ii) is subject
      to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain its secrecy and confidentiality.Confidential
      Information includes, but is not limited to, the following categories: (1) business
      information (business plans, strategies, and models), (2) technical information
      (technical specifications and documentation, research and development activities),
      (3) customer and market information (customer lists and contact information,
      sales histories and patterns), (4) personnel and internal information (employee
      lists and contact information, employment agreements and personnel files), (5)
      intellectual property (trade secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications,
      copyrights and copyright applications, trademarks and trademark applications),
      (6) strategic information (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses
      and strategies). Software code shall also be included into the confidential
      information.Confidential Information shall not include information that: (a)
      is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure
      by Receiving Party or its Representatives; (b) was available to Receiving Party
      on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c)
      becomes available to Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a person
      other than Disclosing Party who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality
      obligation to Disclosing Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving
      Party without reference to or use of any Confidential Information. The name
      of the dog of the Receiving Party is Bob.The designation of information as Confidential
      Information shall not be determinative of whether such information constitutes
      a trade secret under applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain
      the exclusive property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no
      rights, by license or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except
      as expressly provided herein.a. Maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential
      Information and not disclose it to any third party without the prior written
      consent of the Disclosing Party.b. Use the Confidential Information solely for
      the purpose of evaluating or engaging in the potential business collaboration.c.
      Take all necessary precautions to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential
      Information, which shall be no less than the precautions it takes to protect
      its own confidential information.Confidential Information does not include information
      that:a. Is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act of the Receiving
      Party.b. Is already known to the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure.c.
      Is lawfully received from a third party without breach of this Agreement.d.
      Is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference
      to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information.Upon termination of this
      Agreement or upon request, the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing
      Confidential Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing
      Party's discretion.In the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving
      Party, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition
      to any other remedy available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges
      that a breach of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing
      Party for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition
      to injunctive relief, the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages
      in the amount of $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use
      of Confidential Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable
      estimate of the damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.Nothing in this
      Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving Party,
      by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential

      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list of concepts.\\n\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\\n
      \   - Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P1\\\", etc.), optionally followed by additional information about the paragraph,
      which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n    - Each paragraph includes sentences,
      each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the sentence and, optionally, additional
      information about the sentence, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n
      \   - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document.\\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed
      within the document paragraphs.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract
      zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure are
      specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      paragraphs, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with
      an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list.\\n\\nFollow these additional rules:\\n\\n-
      Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following answer format (do
      not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\\n\\n-
      Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\"
      and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match
      exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n
      \   -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an array of objects with
      mandatory fields \\\"value\\\" and \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\". If the concept
      is not found or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\\n
      \       --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items for the
      concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\". Each extracted
      item's object, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n        --- The value of \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\" must be an array
      of objects with mandatory fields \\\"reference_paragraph_id\\\", which holds
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \\\"reference_sentence_ids\\\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\\n\\n- Item object structure:\\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding
      the extracted item.\\n        --- If a specific structure is provided for a
      concept under \u201CExpected structure,\u201D the extracted item value must
      follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n
      \       --- If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\"
      the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n        --- If there are
      example items (\u201CExtracted concept examples\u201D), the extracted item value
      should follow the same style and formatting.\\n        --- When extracting string
      values, translate them in English if the original language of the document is
      not English.\\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph
      based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each object should include:\\n
      \       --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field holding the provided ID
      of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match exactly the provided
      ID for the paragraph (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.).\\n        ---
      reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array of the provided IDs
      of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the item was extracted
      for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the provided ID for the
      sentence (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S2\\\", etc.).\\n\\n- Types of
      extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item type\\\"
      (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure that the value of
      each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type. Python
      types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point
      number, dict for object, etc.).\\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or
      modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling missing or multiple items:\\n
      \   -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still contain
      an entry for that concept with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    --
      If multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate entry
      within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n    --
      Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON array.\\n

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,

      whether in oral, written, electronic, or other form or media, whether or not
      marked, designated, or otherwise identified as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has
      been or may be disclosed to, accessed by, or observed by Receiving Party, which
      (i) has actual or potential economic value by virtue of not being generally
      known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons
      who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, or (ii) is subject
      to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain its secrecy and confidentiality.Confidential

      a trade secret under applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain
      the exclusive property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no
      rights, by license or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except
      as expressly provided herein.a. Maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n- Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.), includes a name,
      and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that
      might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n- Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph and, optionally, additional
      information about the paragraph, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      that paragraph's ID under the aspect's list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph
      does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4.
      Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be
      a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For
      each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The
      aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array
      of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary,
      code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse

      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments represent
      portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their limited context.
      When working with fragments, focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n2. Aspect: A defined
      area or topic within a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect
      corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task. For example:\n-

      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and

      Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.),
      includes a name, and has a description.\n- Aspects describe themes, topics,
      or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n-
      Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph and, optionally, additional
      information about the paragraph, which may be helpful during your analysis.\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect''s name and description),
      include that paragraph''s ID under the aspect''s list of paragraph IDs.\n- If
      a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s
      list.\n\n4. Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\n- Your output
      must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\n-

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
