    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects. Your task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n-
      Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\",
      etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes,
      topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine
      each paragraph\\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example,
      \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n- You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\\n- A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none
      of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the
      aspect's name and description), include that paragraph's ID under the aspect's
      list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not
      include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final answer in the
      specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each
      object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For each aspect (in the order they
      are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier,
      e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array of the paragraph IDs that
      address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If
      an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids
      array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other
      formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse the following answer format as a
      guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding text or ```json delimiters
      should be included).\\n\\n======\\nANSWER FORMAT (MANDATORY):\\n[\\n    {\\n

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects. Your task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n-
      Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\",
      etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes,
      topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine
      each paragraph\\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example,
      \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n- You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\\n- A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none
      of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the
      aspect's name and description), include that paragraph's ID under the aspect's
      list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not
      include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final answer in the
      specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each
      object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For each aspect (in the order they
      are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier,
      e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array of the paragraph IDs that
      address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If
      an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids
      array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other
      formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse the following answer format as a
      guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding text or ```json delimiters
      should be included).\\n\\n======\\nANSWER FORMAT (MANDATORY):\\n[\\n    {\\n

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list
      of concepts.\\n\\nYour task is to:\\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs
      and their sentences.\\n    - Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID
      (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.).\\n    - Each paragraph includes
      sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the sentence.\\n    - Note that paragraphs
      are listed in the same order they appear in the original document.\\n    - You
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list
      is addressed within the document paragraphs.\\n3. For each concept that appears,
      extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure
      are specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      paragraphs, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with
      an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list.\\n\\nFollow these additional rules:\\n\\n-
      Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following answer format (do
      not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\\n\\n-
      Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\"
      and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match
      exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n
      \   -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an array of objects with
      mandatory fields \\\"value\\\" and \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\". If the concept
      is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\\n
      \       --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or
      inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information present).\\n
      \       --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items for the
      concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\". Each extracted
      item's object, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n        --- The value of \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\" must be an array
      of objects with mandatory fields \\\"reference_paragraph_id\\\", which holds
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \\\"reference_sentence_ids\\\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\\n\\n- Item object structure:\\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding
      the extracted item.\\n        --- If a specific structure is provided for a
      concept under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" the extracted item value must follow
      that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n        ---
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\" the
      extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n        --- If available labels
      are provided for a concept under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item
      value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none
      of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\\n
      \       --- If there are example items (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"),
      the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\\n        ---
      When extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects
      for each paragraph based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each
      object should include:\\n        --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field
      holding the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match
      exactly the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.).\\n        --- reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array
      of the provided IDs of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the
      item was extracted for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the
      provided ID for the sentence (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S2\\\", etc.).\\n\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure that the
      value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type.
      Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for
      floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling missing or multiple
      items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still
      contain an entry for that concept with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if none
      of the predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array empty.\\n    -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\"
      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n
      \   -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON
      array.\\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other formatting

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n\\nYour task is to:\\n1.
      Read through the document text provided.\\n2. Identify whether each concept
      in the concepts list is addressed within the document text.\\n3. For each concept
      that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item
      format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a JSON array
      containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a concept is
      not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry in the final
      JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list.\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following
      answer format (do not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory
      text).\\n\\n- Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two
      keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of
      \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\",
      \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an
      array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave
      the array empty ([]).\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly
      mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information
      present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted
      items for the concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\".
      Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n\\n- Item structure:\\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for
      a concept under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" you must follow that structure for
      all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If a rating scale
      is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\" the extracted item value
      must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available labels are provided for a concept
      under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item value must be a list containing
      only labels from the predefined set. If none of the predefined labels apply,
      do not extract any items for that concept.\\n    -- If there are example items
      (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"), try to follow the same style and formatting
      for your extracted items.\\n    -- When extracting string values, translate
      them in English if the original language of the document is not English.\\n\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure your extracted
      items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string,
      int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\\n
      \   -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available
      labels:\\\" section: if none of the predefined labels apply to the content,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty.\\n    -- For concepts that have
      an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if multiple labels apply to the same instance
      or context, include them all in a single extracted item with multiple labels
      in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g., {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}).
      Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct instances
      or contexts that warrant separate classification.\\n    -- For concepts that
      do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if multiple items are found
      for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations,
      or text outside of the JSON array.\\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in
      backticks or any other formatting characters.\\n\\n======\\nANSWER FORMAT (MANDATORY):\\n[\\n

      TEXT:\\nThe purpose of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information
      that may be disclosed between the parties during discussions and engagements

      other form or media, whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified
      as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has been or may be disclosed to, accessed by,
      or observed by Receiving Party, which (i) has actual or potential economic value
      by virtue of not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable
      by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure
      or use, or (ii) is subject to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain
      its secrecy and confidentiality.\\n\\nConfidential Information includes, but

      secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications, copyrights and copyright
      applications, trademarks and trademark applications), (6) strategic information
      (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses and strategies). Software
      code shall also be included into the confidential information.\\n\\nConfidential
      Information shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally
      available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Receiving Party
      or its Representatives; (b) was available to Receiving Party on a non-confidential
      basis prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) becomes available to

      Party who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality obligation to Disclosing
      Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving Party without reference
      to or use of any Confidential Information. The name of the dog of the Receiving
      Party is Bob.\\n\\nThe designation of information as Confidential Information
      shall not be determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret
      under applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive
      property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license
      or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided
      herein.\\n\\na. Maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information
      and not disclose it to any third party without the prior written consent of
      the Disclosing Party.\\n\\nb. Use the Confidential Information solely for the
      purpose of evaluating or engaging in the potential business collaboration.\\n\\nc.
      Take all necessary precautions to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential
      Information, which shall be no less than the precautions it takes to protect
      its own confidential information.\\n\\n4. Exclusions from Confidential Information:\\n\\nConfidential
      Information does not include information that:\\n\\na. Is or becomes publicly
      known through no wrongful act of the Receiving Party.\\n\\nb. Is already known
      to the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure.\\n\\nc. Is lawfully received
      from a third party without breach of this Agreement.\\n\\nd. Is independently
      developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing
      Party's Confidential Information.\\n\\nUpon termination of this Agreement or
      upon request, the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing Confidential

      Party, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition
      to any other remedy available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges

      Party for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition
      to injunctive relief, the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages
      in the amount of $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use
      of Confidential Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable
      estimate of the damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\\n\\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below

      that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item
      format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a JSON array
      containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a concept is

      the array empty ([]).\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly
      mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information
      present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted
      items for the concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\".
      Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n\\n- Item structure:\\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for
      a concept under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" you must follow that structure for
      all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If a rating scale
      is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\" the extracted item value
      must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available labels are provided for a concept
      under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item value must be a list containing
      only labels from the predefined set. If none of the predefined labels apply,
      do not extract any items for that concept.\\n    -- If there are example items
      (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"), try to follow the same style and formatting
      for your extracted items.\\n    -- When extracting string values, translate
      them in English if the original language of the document is not English.\\n\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure your extracted
      items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string,
      int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\\n
      \   -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available
      labels:\\\" section: if none of the predefined labels apply to the content,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty.\\n    -- For concepts that have
      an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if multiple labels apply to the same instance
      or context, include them all in a single extracted item with multiple labels
      in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g., {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}).
      Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct instances
      or contexts that warrant separate classification.\\n    -- For concepts that
      do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if multiple items are found
      for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\"

      property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license
      or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided
      herein.\\n\\na. Maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information

      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR

      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,

      other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, or (ii)
      is subject to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain its secrecy
      and confidentiality.\\n\\nConfidential Information includes, but is not limited
      to, the following categories: (1) business information (business plans, strategies,
      and models), (2) technical information (technical specifications and documentation,
      research and development activities), (3) customer and market information (customer

      know-how, patents and patent applications, copyrights and copyright applications,
      trademarks and trademark applications), (6) strategic information (merger and
      acquisition plans, competitive analyses and strategies). Software code shall

      the Disclosing Party.\\n\\nb. Use the Confidential Information solely for the
      purpose of evaluating or engaging in the potential business collaboration.\\n\\nc.
      Take all necessary precautions to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential

      to injunctive relief, the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages
      in the amount of $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use
      of Confidential Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable

      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information

      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below

      \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an
      array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave
      the array empty ([]).\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly
      mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information
      present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted
      items for the concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\".
      Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n\\n- Item structure:\\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for
      a concept under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" you must follow that structure for
      all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If a rating scale
      is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\" the extracted item value
      must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available labels are provided for a concept
      under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item value must be a list containing
      only labels from the predefined set. If none of the predefined labels apply,
      do not extract any items for that concept.\\n    -- If there are example items
      (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"), try to follow the same style and formatting
      for your extracted items.\\n    -- When extracting string values, translate
      them in English if the original language of the document is not English.\\n\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure your extracted

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n\\nYour task is to:\\n1.
      Read through the document text provided.\\n2. Identify whether each concept

      that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item
      format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a JSON array
      containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a concept is
      not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry in the final
      JSON output but with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list.\\n\\nFollow these
      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following
      answer format (do not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory

      array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave
      the array empty ([]).\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly
      mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information
      present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted
      items for the concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\".
      Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n\\n- Item structure:\\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for
      a concept under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" you must follow that structure for
      all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If a rating scale
      is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\" the extracted item value
      must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available labels are provided for a concept
      under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item value must be a list containing
      only labels from the predefined set. If none of the predefined labels apply,
      do not extract any items for that concept.\\n    -- If there are example items
      (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"), try to follow the same style and formatting
      for your extracted items.\\n    -- When extracting string values, translate
      them in English if the original language of the document is not English.\\n\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure your extracted
      items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string,
      int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\\n
      \   -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available
      labels:\\\" section: if none of the predefined labels apply to the content,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty.\\n    -- For concepts that have
      an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if multiple labels apply to the same instance
      or context, include them all in a single extracted item with multiple labels
      in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g., {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}).
      Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct instances
      or contexts that warrant separate classification.\\n    -- For concepts that
      do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if multiple items are found
      for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations,

      that has been or may be disclosed to, accessed by, or observed by Receiving
      Party, which (i) has actual or potential economic value by virtue of not being
      generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by,
      other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, or (ii)
      is subject to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain its secrecy

      be determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret under
      applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive property
      of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license or
      otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided
      herein.\\n\\na. Maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information
      and not disclose it to any third party without the prior written consent of

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list
      of concepts.\\n\\nYour task is to:\\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs
      and their sentences.\\n    - Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID
      (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.).\\n    - Each paragraph includes
      sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the sentence.\\n    - Note that paragraphs
      are listed in the same order they appear in the original document.\\n    - You
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list
      is addressed within the document paragraphs.\\n3. For each concept that appears,
      extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure
      are specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      paragraphs, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with
      an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list.\\n\\nFollow these additional rules:\\n\\n-
      Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following answer format (do
      not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\\n\\n-
      Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\"
      and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match
      exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n
      \   -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an array of objects with
      mandatory fields \\\"value\\\" and \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\". If the concept
      is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\\n
      \       --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or
      inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information present).\\n
      \       --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items for the
      concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\". Each extracted
      item's object, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n        --- The value of \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\" must be an array
      of objects with mandatory fields \\\"reference_paragraph_id\\\", which holds
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \\\"reference_sentence_ids\\\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\\n\\n- Item object structure:\\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding
      the extracted item.\\n        --- If a specific structure is provided for a
      concept under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" the extracted item value must follow
      that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n        ---
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\" the
      extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n        --- If available labels
      are provided for a concept under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item
      value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none
      of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\\n
      \       --- If there are example items (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"),
      the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\\n        ---
      When extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects
      for each paragraph based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each
      object should include:\\n        --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field
      holding the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match
      exactly the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.).\\n        --- reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array
      of the provided IDs of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the
      item was extracted for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the
      provided ID for the sentence (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S2\\\", etc.).\\n\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure that the
      value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type.
      Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for
      floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling missing or multiple
      items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still
      contain an entry for that concept with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if none
      of the predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array empty.\\n    -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\"
      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n
      \   -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON
      array.\\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other formatting
      characters.\\n\\n======\\nANSWER FORMAT (MANDATORY):\\n[\\n    {\\n        \\\"concept_id\\\":

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list
      of concepts.\\n\\nYour task is to:\\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs
      and their sentences.\\n    - Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID
      (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.).\\n    - Each paragraph includes
      sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the sentence.\\n    - Note that paragraphs
      are listed in the same order they appear in the original document.\\n    - You
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list
      is addressed within the document paragraphs.\\n3. For each concept that appears,
      extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure
      are specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      paragraphs, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with
      an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list.\\n\\nFollow these additional rules:\\n\\n-
      Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following answer format (do
      not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\\n\\n-
      Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\"
      and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match
      exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n
      \   -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an array of objects with
      mandatory fields \\\"value\\\" and \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\". If the concept
      is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\\n
      \       --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or
      inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information present).\\n
      \       --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items for the
      concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\". Each extracted
      item's object, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n        --- The value of \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\" must be an array
      of objects with mandatory fields \\\"reference_paragraph_id\\\", which holds
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \\\"reference_sentence_ids\\\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\\n\\n- Item object structure:\\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding
      the extracted item.\\n        --- If a specific structure is provided for a
      concept under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" the extracted item value must follow
      that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n        ---
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\" the
      extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n        --- If available labels
      are provided for a concept under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item
      value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none
      of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\\n
      \       --- If there are example items (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"),
      the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\\n        ---
      When extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects
      for each paragraph based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each
      object should include:\\n        --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field
      holding the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match
      exactly the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.).\\n        --- reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array
      of the provided IDs of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the
      item was extracted for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the
      provided ID for the sentence (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S2\\\", etc.).\\n\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure that the
      value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type.
      Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for
      floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling missing or multiple
      items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still
      contain an entry for that concept with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if none
      of the predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array empty.\\n    -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\"
      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n
      \   -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON
      array.\\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other formatting

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects. Your task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n-
      Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\",
      etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes,
      topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine
      each paragraph\\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example,
      \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n- You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\\n- A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none
      of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the
      aspect's name and description), include the paragraph's ID and provide a justification,
      detailing why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect.\\n- If a paragraph does
      not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4.
      Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be
      a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For
      each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The
      aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraphs: An array
      of objects for each paragraph that addresses or relates to the aspect. Each
      object should include:\\n        --- paragraph_id: The provided paragraph ID,
      e.g., \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\".\\n        --- justification: A justification of
      why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect. Ensure the justification is specific
      and directly ties the content of the paragraph to the aspect's defining features.
      Never reference any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as aspect
      IDs like \\\"A0\\\", or paragraph IDs like \\\"P0\\\") in the justification.\\n
      \           ---- Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential
      details.\\n            ---- Justification should be no longer than 2 sentences.\\n
      \           ---- Justification should be in English.\\n    -- If an aspect has
      no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraphs array ([]).\\n-
      Do not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other formatting beyond
      the JSON array.\\n\\nUse the following answer format as a guide for your final
      answer (remember: no surrounding text or ```json delimiters should be included).\\n\\n======\\nANSWER

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects. Your task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n-
      Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\",
      etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes,
      topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine
      each paragraph\\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example,
      \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n- You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\\n- A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none
      of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the
      aspect's name and description), include that paragraph's ID under the aspect's
      list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not
      include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final answer in the
      specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each
      object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For each aspect (in the order they
      are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier,
      e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array of the paragraph IDs that
      address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If
      an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids
      array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other
      formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse the following answer format as a
      guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding text or ```json delimiters
      should be included).\\n\\n======\\nANSWER FORMAT (MANDATORY):\\n[\\n    {\\n

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list
      of concepts.\\n\\nYour task is to:\\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs
      and their sentences.\\n    - Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID
      (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.).\\n    - Each paragraph includes
      sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the sentence.\\n    - Note that paragraphs
      are listed in the same order they appear in the original document.\\n    - You
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list
      is addressed within the document paragraphs.\\n3. For each concept that appears,
      extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure
      are specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      paragraphs, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with
      an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list.\\n\\nFollow these additional rules:\\n\\n-
      Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following answer format (do
      not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\\n\\n-
      Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\"
      and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match
      exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n
      \   -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an array of objects with
      mandatory fields \\\"value\\\" and \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\". If the concept
      is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\\n
      \       --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or
      inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information present).\\n
      \       --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items for the
      concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\". Each extracted
      item's object, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n        --- The value of \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\" must be an array
      of objects with mandatory fields \\\"reference_paragraph_id\\\", which holds
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \\\"reference_sentence_ids\\\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\\n\\n- Item object structure:\\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding
      the extracted item.\\n        --- If a specific structure is provided for a
      concept under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" the extracted item value must follow
      that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n        ---
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\" the
      extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n        --- If available labels
      are provided for a concept under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item
      value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none
      of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\\n
      \       --- If there are example items (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"),
      the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\\n        ---
      When extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects
      for each paragraph based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each
      object should include:\\n        --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field
      holding the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match
      exactly the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.).\\n        --- reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array
      of the provided IDs of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the
      item was extracted for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the
      provided ID for the sentence (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S2\\\", etc.).\\n\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure that the
      value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type.
      Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for
      floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling missing or multiple
      items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still
      contain an entry for that concept with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if none
      of the predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array empty.\\n    -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\"
      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n\\nYour task is to:\\n1.

      that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item
      format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a JSON array
      containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a concept is

      \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\",
      \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an
      array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave
      the array empty ([]).\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly
      mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information
      present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted
      items for the concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\".
      Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n\\n- Item structure:\\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for
      a concept under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" you must follow that structure for
      all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If a rating scale
      is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\" the extracted item value
      must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available labels are provided for a concept
      under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item value must be a list containing
      only labels from the predefined set. If none of the predefined labels apply,
      do not extract any items for that concept.\\n    -- If there are example items
      (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"), try to follow the same style and formatting
      for your extracted items.\\n    -- When extracting string values, translate
      them in English if the original language of the document is not English.\\n\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure your extracted
      items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string,
      int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\\n
      \   -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available
      labels:\\\" section: if none of the predefined labels apply to the content,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty.\\n    -- For concepts that have
      an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if multiple labels apply to the same instance
      or context, include them all in a single extracted item with multiple labels
      in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g., {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}).
      Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct instances
      or contexts that warrant separate classification.\\n    -- For concepts that
      do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if multiple items are found
      for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations,

      TEXT:\\nThe purpose of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information
      that may be disclosed between the parties during discussions and engagements
      regarding potential business collaborations and partnerships.\\n\\nFor purposes
      of this Agreement, \\\"Confidential Information\\\" means any and all non-public
      information, conveyed in all forms, whether in oral, written, electronic, or
      other form or media, whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified
      as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has been or may be disclosed to, accessed by,
      or observed by Receiving Party, which (i) has actual or potential economic value

      secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications, copyrights and copyright
      applications, trademarks and trademark applications), (6) strategic information
      (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses and strategies). Software
      code shall also be included into the confidential information.\\n\\nConfidential
      Information shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally

      Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving Party without reference
      to or use of any Confidential Information. The name of the dog of the Receiving
      Party is Bob.\\n\\nThe designation of information as Confidential Information
      shall not be determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret
      under applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive
      property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license
      or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided
      herein.\\n\\na. Maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information
      and not disclose it to any third party without the prior written consent of
      the Disclosing Party.\\n\\nb. Use the Confidential Information solely for the
      purpose of evaluating or engaging in the potential business collaboration.\\n\\nc.
      Take all necessary precautions to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential

      time of disclosure.\\n\\nc. Is lawfully received from a third party without
      breach of this Agreement.\\n\\nd. Is independently developed by the Receiving
      Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information.\\n\\nUpon

      would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief, the Receiving
      Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of $25,000 for each
      instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information, which

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list
      of concepts.\\n\\nYour task is to:\\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs
      and their sentences.\\n    - Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID
      (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.).\\n    - Each paragraph includes
      sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the sentence.\\n    - Note that paragraphs
      are listed in the same order they appear in the original document.\\n    - You
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list
      is addressed within the document paragraphs.\\n3. For each concept that appears,
      extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure
      are specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      paragraphs, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with
      an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list.\\n\\nFollow these additional rules:\\n\\n-
      Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following answer format (do
      not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\\n\\n-
      Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\"
      and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match
      exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n
      \   -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an array of objects with
      mandatory fields \\\"value\\\" and \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\". If the concept
      is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\\n
      \       --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or
      inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information present).\\n
      \       --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items for the
      concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\". Each extracted
      item's object, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n        --- The value of \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\" must be an array
      of objects with mandatory fields \\\"reference_paragraph_id\\\", which holds
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \\\"reference_sentence_ids\\\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\\n\\n- Item object structure:\\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding
      the extracted item.\\n        --- If a specific structure is provided for a
      concept under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" the extracted item value must follow
      that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n        ---
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\" the
      extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n        --- If available labels
      are provided for a concept under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item
      value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none
      of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\\n
      \       --- If there are example items (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"),
      the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\\n        ---
      When extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects
      for each paragraph based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each
      object should include:\\n        --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field
      holding the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match
      exactly the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.).\\n        --- reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array
      of the provided IDs of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the
      item was extracted for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the
      provided ID for the sentence (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S2\\\", etc.).\\n\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure that the
      value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type.
      Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for
      floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling missing or multiple
      items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still
      contain an entry for that concept with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if none
      of the predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array empty.\\n    -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\"
      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find document text and a list of concepts.\\n\\nYour task is to:\\n1.

      that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item
      format and structure are specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a JSON array
      containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a concept is
      not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry in the final

      additional rules:\\n\\n- Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following
      answer format (do not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory

      keys: \\\"concept_id\\\" and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of
      \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\",
      \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an
      array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave
      the array empty ([]).\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly
      mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information
      present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted
      items for the concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\".
      Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n\\n- Item structure:\\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for
      a concept under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" you must follow that structure for
      all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If a rating scale
      is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\" the extracted item value
      must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available labels are provided for a concept
      under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item value must be a list containing
      only labels from the predefined set. If none of the predefined labels apply,
      do not extract any items for that concept.\\n    -- If there are example items
      (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"), try to follow the same style and formatting
      for your extracted items.\\n    -- When extracting string values, translate
      them in English if the original language of the document is not English.\\n\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure your extracted
      items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string,
      int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\\n
      \   -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available
      labels:\\\" section: if none of the predefined labels apply to the content,
      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty.\\n    -- For concepts that have
      an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if multiple labels apply to the same instance
      or context, include them all in a single extracted item with multiple labels
      in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g., {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}).
      Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct instances
      or contexts that warrant separate classification.\\n    -- For concepts that
      do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if multiple items are found
      for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\"

      TEXT:\\nThe purpose of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information
      that may be disclosed between the parties during discussions and engagements

      Party is Bob.\\n\\nThe designation of information as Confidential Information
      shall not be determinative of whether such information constitutes a trade secret
      under applicable law. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive
      property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party shall have no rights, by license
      or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information except as expressly provided
      herein.\\n\\na. Maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information

      Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of $25,000 for each
      instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information, which
      the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the damages likely to

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list
      of concepts.\\n\\nYour task is to:\\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs
      and their sentences.\\n    - Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID
      (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.).\\n    - Each paragraph includes
      sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the sentence.\\n    - Note that paragraphs
      are listed in the same order they appear in the original document.\\n    - You
      may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus
      on extracting information from the available content without making assumptions
      about missing parts.\\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list
      is addressed within the document paragraphs.\\n3. For each concept that appears,
      extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure
      are specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      paragraphs, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with
      an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list.\\n\\nFollow these additional rules:\\n\\n-
      Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following answer format (do
      not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\\n\\n-
      Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\"
      and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match
      exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n
      \   -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an array of objects with
      mandatory fields \\\"value\\\" and \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\". If the concept
      is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\\n
      \       --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or
      inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information present).\\n
      \       --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items for the
      concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\". Each extracted
      item's object, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n        --- The value of \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\" must be an array
      of objects with mandatory fields \\\"reference_paragraph_id\\\", which holds
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \\\"reference_sentence_ids\\\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\\n\\n- Item object structure:\\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding
      the extracted item.\\n        --- If a specific structure is provided for a
      concept under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" the extracted item value must follow
      that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n        ---
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\" the
      extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n        --- If available labels
      are provided for a concept under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item
      value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none
      of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\\n
      \       --- If there are example items (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"),
      the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\\n        ---
      When extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects
      for each paragraph based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each
      object should include:\\n        --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field
      holding the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match
      exactly the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.).\\n        --- reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array
      of the provided IDs of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the
      item was extracted for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the
      provided ID for the sentence (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S2\\\", etc.).\\n\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure that the
      value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type.
      Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for
      floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling missing or multiple
      items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still
      contain an entry for that concept with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if none
      of the predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array empty.\\n    -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\"
      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects. Your task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n-
      Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\",
      etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes,
      topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine
      each paragraph\\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example,
      \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n- You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\\n- A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none
      of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the
      aspect's name and description), include that paragraph's ID under the aspect's
      list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not
      include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final answer in the
      specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each
      object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For each aspect (in the order they
      are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier,
      e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array of the paragraph IDs that
      address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If
      an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids
      array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other
      formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse the following answer format as a

    body: '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You will be assigned tasks involving
      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file containing
      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints,
      photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\n-
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger
      document and should be analyzed within their limited context. When working with
      fragments, focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain textual or
      visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can be directly
      read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints,
      tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --
      The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\n  -- The expected output
      format and structure requirements\n  -- Any constraints or special handling
      instructions\n\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n  -- All
      extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n  --
      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --
      Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field
      names\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code
      blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n-
      Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the
      task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions,
      include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when
      required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or
      noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References (when required):
      When required by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted
      data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering
      to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across
      diverse document analysis tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"Below you will
      find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and a list of
      aspects. Your task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n- Each aspect
      is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.), includes
      a name, and has a description.\n- Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria
      that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n- Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.),
      followed by the full text of the paragraph.\n- Note that paragraphs are listed
      in the same order they appear in the original document; therefore, context from
      surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular paragraph is relevant
      to an aspect.\n- You may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n- A
      paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect''s name and description),
      include that paragraph''s ID under the aspect''s list of paragraph IDs.\n- If
      a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s
      list.\n\n4. Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\n- Your output
      must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\n-
      For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n    -- aspect_id:
      The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array
      of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\", \"P2\"].\n    --
      If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids

      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints,
      photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\n-
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger
      document and should be analyzed within their limited context. When working with
      fragments, focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain textual or
      visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can be directly
      read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints,
      tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --
      The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\n  -- The expected output
      format and structure requirements\n  -- Any constraints or special handling
      instructions\n\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n  -- All
      extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n  --
      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --
      Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field
      names\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code
      blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n-
      Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the
      task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions,
      include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when
      required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or
      noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References (when required):
      When required by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted
      data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering
      to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across
      diverse document analysis tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"Below you will

      by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive
      relief in addition to any other remedy available at law or in equity. The Receiving
      Party acknowledges that a breach of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm
      to the Disclosing Party for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy.
      In addition to injunctive relief, the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated
      damages in the amount of $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure
      or use of Confidential Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable
      estimate of the damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\n------\n"}],"model":"gpt-4.1-mini","max_tokens":4096,"stream":false,"temperature":0.3,"top_p":0.3}'
