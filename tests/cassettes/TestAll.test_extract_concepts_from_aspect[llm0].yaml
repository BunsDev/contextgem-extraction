      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n- Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.), includes a name,
      and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that
      might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n- Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph and, optionally, additional
      information about the paragraph, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      that paragraph's ID under the aspect's list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph
      does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4.
      Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be
      a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For
      each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The
      aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array
      of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary,
      code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse
      the following answer format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding

      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n- Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.), includes a name,
      and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that
      might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n- Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph and, optionally, additional
      information about the paragraph, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      that paragraph's ID under the aspect's list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph
      does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4.
      Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be
      a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For
      each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The
      aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array
      of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary,
      code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse
      the following answer format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding

      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list of concepts.\\n\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\\n
      \   - Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P1\\\", etc.), optionally followed by additional information about the paragraph,
      which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n    - Each paragraph includes sentences,
      each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the sentence and, optionally, additional
      information about the sentence, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n
      \   - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document.\\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed
      within the document paragraphs.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract
      zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure are
      specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      paragraphs, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with
      an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list.\\n\\nFollow these additional rules:\\n\\n-
      Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following answer format (do
      not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\\n\\n-
      Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\"
      and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match
      exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n
      \   -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an array of objects with
      mandatory fields \\\"value\\\" and \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\". If the concept
      is not found or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\\n
      \       --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items for the
      concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\". Each extracted
      item's object, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n        --- The value of \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\" must be an array
      of objects with mandatory fields \\\"reference_paragraph_id\\\", which holds
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \\\"reference_sentence_ids\\\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\\n\\n- Item object structure:\\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding
      the extracted item.\\n        --- If a specific structure is provided for a
      concept under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" the extracted item value must follow
      that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n        ---
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\" the
      extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n        --- If available labels
      are provided for a concept under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item
      value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none
      of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\\n
      \       --- If there are example items (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"),
      the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\\n        ---
      When extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects
      for each paragraph based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each
      object should include:\\n        --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field
      holding the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match
      exactly the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.).\\n        --- reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array
      of the provided IDs of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the
      item was extracted for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the
      provided ID for the sentence (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S2\\\", etc.).\\n\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure that the
      value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type.
      Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for
      floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling missing or multiple
      items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still
      contain an entry for that concept with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if none
      of the predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array empty.\\n    -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\"
      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n
      \   -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON
      array.\\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other formatting

      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find document

      extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\\n\\n- Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each
      concept specifies an \\\"extracted item type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted

      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list of concepts.\\n\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\\n
      \   - Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P1\\\", etc.), optionally followed by additional information about the paragraph,
      which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n    - Each paragraph includes sentences,
      each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the sentence and, optionally, additional
      information about the sentence, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n
      \   - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document.\\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed
      within the document paragraphs.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract
      zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure are
      specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      paragraphs, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with
      an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list.\\n\\nFollow these additional rules:\\n\\n-
      Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following answer format (do
      not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\\n\\n-
      Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\"
      and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match
      exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n
      \   -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an array of objects with
      mandatory fields \\\"value\\\" and \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\". If the concept
      is not found or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\\n
      \       --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items for the
      concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\". Each extracted
      item's object, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n        --- The value of \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\" must be an array
      of objects with mandatory fields \\\"reference_paragraph_id\\\", which holds
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \\\"reference_sentence_ids\\\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\\n\\n- Item object structure:\\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding
      the extracted item.\\n        --- If a specific structure is provided for a
      concept under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" the extracted item value must follow
      that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n        ---
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\" the
      extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n        --- If available labels
      are provided for a concept under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item
      value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none
      of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\\n
      \       --- If there are example items (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"),
      the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\\n        ---
      When extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects
      for each paragraph based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each
      object should include:\\n        --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field
      holding the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match
      exactly the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.).\\n        --- reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array
      of the provided IDs of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the
      item was extracted for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the
      provided ID for the sentence (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S2\\\", etc.).\\n\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure that the
      value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type.
      Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for
      floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling missing or multiple
      items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still
      contain an entry for that concept with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if none
      of the predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array empty.\\n    -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\"
      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n
      \   -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON
      array.\\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other formatting

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document

      more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure are specified
      for each concept.\\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data,

      extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\\n\\n- Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each
      concept specifies an \\\"extracted item type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted
      item type\\\"). Ensure your extracted items strictly match that type. Python
      types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point

      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n

      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n- Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.), includes a name,
      and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that
      might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n- Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph and, optionally, additional
      information about the paragraph, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      the paragraph's ID and provide a justification, detailing why the paragraph
      is relevant to the aspect.\\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect,
      do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final answer
      in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects,
      each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For each aspect (in the order
      they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier,
      e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph
      that addresses or relates to the aspect. Each object should include:\\n        ---
      paragraph_id: The provided paragraph ID, e.g., \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\".\\n        ---
      justification: A justification of why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect.
      Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the content of the paragraph
      to the aspect's defining features. Never reference any of the structural IDs
      provided in this prompt (such as aspect IDs like \\\"A0\\\", or paragraph IDs
      like \\\"P0\\\") in the justification.\\n            ---- Justification should
      be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential details.\\n            ---- Justification
      should be no longer than 2 sentences.\\n            ---- Justification should
      be in English.\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraphs array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary, code
      block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse the following
      answer format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding text
      or ```json delimiters should be included).\\n\\n======\\nANSWER FORMAT (MANDATORY):\\n[\\n

      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n- Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.), includes a name,
      and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that
      might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n- Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph and, optionally, additional
      information about the paragraph, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      that paragraph's ID under the aspect's list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph
      does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4.
      Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be
      a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For
      each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The
      aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array
      of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary,
      code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse

      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list of concepts.\\n\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\\n
      \   - Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P1\\\", etc.), optionally followed by additional information about the paragraph,
      which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n    - Each paragraph includes sentences,
      each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the sentence and, optionally, additional
      information about the sentence, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n
      \   - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document.\\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed
      within the document paragraphs.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract
      zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure are
      specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      paragraphs, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with
      an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list.\\n\\nFollow these additional rules:\\n\\n-
      Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following answer format (do
      not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\\n\\n-
      Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\"
      and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match
      exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n
      \   -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an array of objects with
      mandatory fields \\\"value\\\" and \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\". If the concept
      is not found or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\\n
      \       --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items for the
      concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\". Each extracted
      item's object, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n        --- The value of \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\" must be an array
      of objects with mandatory fields \\\"reference_paragraph_id\\\", which holds
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \\\"reference_sentence_ids\\\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\\n\\n- Item object structure:\\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding
      the extracted item.\\n        --- If a specific structure is provided for a
      concept under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" the extracted item value must follow
      that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n        ---
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\" the
      extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n        --- If available labels
      are provided for a concept under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item
      value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none
      of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\\n
      \       --- If there are example items (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"),
      the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\\n        ---
      When extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects
      for each paragraph based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each
      object should include:\\n        --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field
      holding the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match
      exactly the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.).\\n        --- reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array
      of the provided IDs of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the
      item was extracted for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the
      provided ID for the sentence (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S2\\\", etc.).\\n\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure that the
      value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type.
      Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for
      floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling missing or multiple
      items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still
      contain an entry for that concept with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if none
      of the predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array empty.\\n    -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\"
      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n
      \   -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON
      array.\\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other formatting

      value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none
      of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\\n
      \       --- If there are example items (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"),

      of the document is not English.\\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects
      for each paragraph based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each
      object should include:\\n        --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field
      holding the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match
      exactly the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.).\\n        --- reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array
      of the provided IDs of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the
      item was extracted for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the
      provided ID for the sentence (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S2\\\", etc.).\\n\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure that the
      value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type.
      Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for
      floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\\n    -- Do not introduce any
      extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling missing or multiple
      items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still
      contain an entry for that concept with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n
      \   -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if none
      of the predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array empty.\\n    -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\"
      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n
      \   -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON
      array.\\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other formatting

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find document

      leave the array empty ([]).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount
      of extracted items for the concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted

      the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available labels

      to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\\n    -- When
      extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\\n\\n- Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each
      concept specifies an \\\"extracted item type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted
      item type\\\"). Ensure your extracted items strictly match that type. Python
      types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point
      number, dict for object, etc.).\\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or
      modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling missing or multiple items:\\n
      \   -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still contain
      an entry for that concept with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n    --
      For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if none of the
      predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array
      empty.\\n    -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of document paragraphs (including sentences) and a list of concepts.\\n\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the provided document paragraphs and their sentences.\\n
      \   - Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P1\\\", etc.), optionally followed by additional information about the paragraph,
      which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n    - Each paragraph includes sentences,
      each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the sentence and, optionally, additional
      information about the sentence, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n
      \   - Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document.\\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed
      within the document paragraphs.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract
      zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure are
      specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted

      not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\\n\\n-
      Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\"

      \       --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items for the
      concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\". Each extracted
      item's object, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n        --- The value of \\\"reference_paragraphs\\\" must be an array
      of objects with mandatory fields \\\"reference_paragraph_id\\\", which holds
      the provided ID of the reference paragraph, and \\\"reference_sentence_ids\\\",
      which holds the provided IDs of the reference sentences within the paragraph.
      Note that not every sentence in the paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant
      reference.\\n\\n- Item object structure:\\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding
      the extracted item.\\n        --- If a specific structure is provided for a
      concept under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" the extracted item value must follow
      that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n        ---
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\" the
      extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n        --- If available labels
      are provided for a concept under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item
      value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none
      of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\\n
      \       --- If there are example items (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"),
      the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\\n        ---
      When extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\\n    -- reference_paragraphs: An array of objects
      for each paragraph based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Each
      object should include:\\n        --- reference_paragraph_id: Mandatory field
      holding the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph ID must match
      exactly the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.).\\n        --- reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding an array
      of the provided IDs of the sentences within the paragraph, based on which the
      item was extracted for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly the
      provided ID for the sentence (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S2\\\", etc.).\\n\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure that the
      value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type.
      Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for
      floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\\n    -- Do not introduce any

      of the predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array empty.\\n    -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,

      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files
      that may contain text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally
      you may be working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These
      fragments represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within
      their limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\\n\\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\\n- Interpretative
      judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based
      on document content.\\n\\nGUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\\n- Understand the context:
      Before processing the document, ensure you comprehend the nature of the document
      and the aspects or concepts you need to focus on.\\n- Follow specific instructions:
      Each task will include detailed instructions, such as which aspects or concepts
      to focus on and how the data should be presented.\\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide
      precise extractions and analysis, ensuring your outputs align with the document's
      intent and context.\\n- Adapt to variability: Documents may differ in structure,
      language, or formatting. Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations
      effectively.\\n\\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted
      and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations
      (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications or
      reasoning for your interpretations.\\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below you will find a list
      of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your
      task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n- Each aspect is identified
      by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\", etc.), includes a name,
      and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria that
      might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine each paragraph\\n- Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph and, optionally, additional
      information about the paragraph, which may be helpful during your analysis.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      that paragraph's ID under the aspect's list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph
      does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4.
      Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be
      a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For
      each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The
      aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array
      of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary,
      code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse

      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file containing
      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments represent
      portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their limited context.
      When working with fragments, focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n2. Aspect: A defined
      area or topic within a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect
      corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task. For example:\n-
      Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\n-
      Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n- CV Aspects:
      Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3. Concept:
      A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived
      from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range
      of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values)
      to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total
      amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n- Analytical insights:
      Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n-
      Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document meets specific
      criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments: Such
      as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n\nGUIDELINES
      FOR YOUR WORK:\n- Understand the context: Before processing the document, ensure
      you comprehend the nature of the document and the aspects or concepts you need
      to focus on.\n- Follow specific instructions: Each task will include detailed
      instructions, such as which aspects or concepts to focus on and how the data
      should be presented.\n- Maintain accuracy: Provide precise extractions and analysis,
      ensuring your outputs align with the document''s intent and context.\n- Adapt
      to variability: Documents may differ in structure, language, or formatting.
      Be flexible and apply reasoning to handle variations effectively.\n\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\n\n\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality
      performance across diverse document analysis tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"Below
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects. Your task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n-
      Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.),
      includes a name, and has a description.\n- Aspects describe themes, topics,
      or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n-
      Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph and, optionally, additional
      information about the paragraph, which may be helpful during your analysis.\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect''s name and description),
      include that paragraph''s ID under the aspect''s list of paragraph IDs.\n- If
      a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect''s
      list.\n\n4. Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\n- Your output
      must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\n-
      For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n    -- aspect_id:
      The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array
      of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\", \"P2\"].\n    --
      If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids
      array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other
      formatting beyond the JSON array.\n\nUse the following answer format as a guide

      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file containing
      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments represent
      portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their limited context.
      When working with fragments, focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n2. Aspect: A defined
      area or topic within a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect
      corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task. For example:\n-
      Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\n-
      Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n- CV Aspects:
      Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed,
      considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3. Concept:
      A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived
      from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a wide range
      of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates, monetary values)
      to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific questions. Concepts
      can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total
      amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n- Analytical insights:
      Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n-
      Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document meets specific
      criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments: Such
      as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document content.\n\nGUIDELINES
      FOR YOUR WORK:\n- Understand the context: Before processing the document, ensure
      you comprehend the nature of the document and the aspects or concepts you need
      to focus on.\n- Follow specific instructions: Each task will include detailed
      instructions, such as which aspects or concepts to focus on and how the data
