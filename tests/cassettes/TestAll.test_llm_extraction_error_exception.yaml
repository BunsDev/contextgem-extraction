    body: '{"model": "llama3.1:8b", "prompt": "### System:\nYou will be assigned tasks
      involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various
      types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide
      accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional
      experience and qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments represent
      portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their limited context.
      When working with fragments, focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain
      textual or visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can
      be directly read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document
      that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject
      or theme described in the task. For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item
      breakdowns, or tax details.\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou
      will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance and context
      within the document.\n\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant
      to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader document
      context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from simple
      entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance
      evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n-
      Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments
      based on document content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization
      using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision
      and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\n\n- Visual content analysis: When
      processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine all visual elements carefully,
      including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\n  --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\n  -- Analyze information
      in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual structure
      and relationships.\n\n- Contextual understanding: Consider the full context
      when performing extractions. A single paragraph or sentence may have different
      meanings depending on surrounding content, document type, and domain-specific
      terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  --
      The nature and type of the document\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you
      need to focus on\n  -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n  --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n\n- Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to
      the specified aspects/concepts\n  -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information has been included\n  -- All mandatory
      fields are present and correctly populated\n\n- Conservative approach: When
      in doubt about whether information qualifies for extraction:\n  -- If the relevance
      is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  -- If multiple interpretations are
      possible, choose the most conservative one\n  -- If information is ambiguous,
      do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly
      to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  -- Add extra fields beyond
      what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field names\n  -- Include explanatory
      text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code blocks or formatting markers
      unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n- Structured outputs:
      Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n-
      Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications
      or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\n\n### User:\nBelow you will find a list of consecutively ordered
      paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your task is to:\n\n1. Read
      and understand the aspects\n- Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for
      example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\n- Aspects
      describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\n\n2.
      Examine each paragraph\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for
      example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n- You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\n- A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none
      of the aspects.\n- If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the
      aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the aspect''s
      list of paragraph IDs.\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not
      include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final answer in the
      specified JSON format\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object
      corresponding to a single aspect.\n- For each aspect (in the order they are
      provided), include:\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g.,
      \"A0\".\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array of the paragraph IDs that address or
      relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\", \"P2\"].\n    -- If an aspect has no related
      paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not
      add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the
      JSON array.\n\nUse the following answer format as a guide for your final answer
      (remember: no surrounding text or ```json delimiters should be included).\n\n======\nANSWER

    body: '{"model": "llama3.1:8b", "prompt": "### System:\nYou will be assigned tasks
      involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various
      types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide
      accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional
      experience and qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments represent
      portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their limited context.
      When working with fragments, focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain
      textual or visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can
      be directly read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document
      that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject
      or theme described in the task. For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item
      breakdowns, or tax details.\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou
      will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance and context
      within the document.\n\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant
      to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader document
      context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from simple
      entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance
      evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n-
      Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments
      based on document content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization
      using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision
      and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\n\n- Visual content analysis: When
      processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine all visual elements carefully,
      including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\n  --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\n  -- Analyze information
      in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual structure
      and relationships.\n\n- Contextual understanding: Consider the full context
      when performing extractions. A single paragraph or sentence may have different
      meanings depending on surrounding content, document type, and domain-specific
      terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  --
      The nature and type of the document\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you
      need to focus on\n  -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n  --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n\n- Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to
      the specified aspects/concepts\n  -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information has been included\n  -- All mandatory
      fields are present and correctly populated\n\n- Conservative approach: When
      in doubt about whether information qualifies for extraction:\n  -- If the relevance
      is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  -- If multiple interpretations are
      possible, choose the most conservative one\n  -- If information is ambiguous,
      do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly
      to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  -- Add extra fields beyond
      what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field names\n  -- Include explanatory
      text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code blocks or formatting markers
      unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n- Structured outputs:
      Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n-
      Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications
      or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\n\n### User:\nBelow you will find a list of consecutively ordered
      paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your task is to:\n\n1. Read
      and understand the aspects\n- Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for
      example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\n- Aspects
      describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\n\n2.
      Examine each paragraph\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for
      example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n- You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\n- A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none
      of the aspects.\n- If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the
      aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the aspect''s
      list of paragraph IDs.\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not
      include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final answer in the
      specified JSON format\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object
      corresponding to a single aspect.\n- For each aspect (in the order they are
      provided), include:\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g.,
      \"A0\".\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array of the paragraph IDs that address or
      relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\", \"P2\"].\n    -- If an aspect has no related
      paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not
      add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the
      JSON array.\n\nUse the following answer format as a guide for your final answer
      (remember: no surrounding text or ```json delimiters should be included).\n\n======\nANSWER

        to the \"Liability\" section (Paragraphs 36-40) and identify the relevant
        information for each paragraph.\n\n**Paragraph 36: Liability**\n\n* This paragraph
        introduces the concept of liability in the agreement.\n* It does not contain
        specific details about the liability cap or penalties for breach.\n\n**Paragraph
        37: Total Liability Cap**\n\n* The total liability of either party for any
        claims arising out of or related to this Agreement shall not exceed the greater
        of (i) $100,000 or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the
        Disclosing Party under any separate business agreement between the parties
        during the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.\n*
        This limitation of liability is cumulative and not per incident.\n\n**Paragraph
        38: Penalties for Breach**\n\n* In the event of a breach of this Agreement
        by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive
        relief in addition to any other remedy available at law or in equity.\n* The
        Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach of this Agreement may cause irreparable
        harm to the Disclosing Party for which monetary damages would be an inadequate
        remedy.\n\n**Paragraph 39: Liquidated Damages**\n\n* In addition to injunctive
        relief, the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the
        amount of $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
        Information.\n* The parties agree that this represents a reasonable estimate
        of the damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\n\n**Paragraph 40:
        No License**\n\n* Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting
        any rights to the Receiving Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the
        Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information, except as expressly set
        forth in this Agreement.\n\nTo answer your question, I will now map out the
        relevant information for each paragraph related to liability:\n\n| Paragraph
        | Liability Cap | Penalties for Breach | Liquidated Damages |\n| --- | ---
        | --- | --- |\n| 36 | Introduced concept of liability |  |  |\n| 37 | $100,000
        or total amount paid under separate business agreement |  |  |\n| 38 | Injunctive
        relief and other remedies available at law or in equity |  |  |\n| 39 | Liquidated
        damages: $25,000 per instance of unauthorized disclosure or use |  |  |\n\nBased
        on this mapping, I can now provide the answer to your question:\n\nThe relevant
        information for each paragraph related to liability is as follows:\n\n* Paragraph
        36 introduces the concept of liability.\n* Paragraph 37 sets a total liability
        cap of $100,000 or the total amount paid under a separate business agreement
        between the parties.\n* Paragraph 38 outlines penalties for breach, including
        injunctive relief and other remedies available at law or in equity.\n* Paragraph
        39 specifies liquidated damages of $25,000 per instance of unauthorized disclosure
        or use.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.",

    body: '{"model": "llama3.1:8b", "prompt": "### System:\nYou will be assigned tasks
      involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various
      types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide
      accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional
      experience and qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments represent
      portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their limited context.
      When working with fragments, focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain
      textual or visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can
      be directly read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document
      that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject
      or theme described in the task. For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item
      breakdowns, or tax details.\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou
      will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance and context
      within the document.\n\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant
      to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader document
      context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from simple
      entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance
      evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n-
      Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments
      based on document content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization
      using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision
      and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\n\n- Visual content analysis: When
      processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine all visual elements carefully,
      including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\n  --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\n  -- Analyze information
      in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual structure
      and relationships.\n\n- Contextual understanding: Consider the full context
      when performing extractions. A single paragraph or sentence may have different
      meanings depending on surrounding content, document type, and domain-specific
      terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  --
      The nature and type of the document\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you
      need to focus on\n  -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n  --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n\n- Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to
      the specified aspects/concepts\n  -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information has been included\n  -- All mandatory
      fields are present and correctly populated\n\n- Conservative approach: When
      in doubt about whether information qualifies for extraction:\n  -- If the relevance
      is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  -- If multiple interpretations are
      possible, choose the most conservative one\n  -- If information is ambiguous,
      do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly
      to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  -- Add extra fields beyond
      what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field names\n  -- Include explanatory
      text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code blocks or formatting markers
      unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n- Structured outputs:
      Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n-
      Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications
      or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\n\n### User:\nBelow you will find document text and a list of
      concepts.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2.
      Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document
      text.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.\n\nFollow
      these additional rules:\n\n- Output format:\nProvide your answer in only the
      following answer format (do not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory
      text).\n\n- Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two
      keys: \"concept_id\" and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\"
      must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    --
      The value of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed
      or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified under \"Amount
      of extracted items\". Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be
      part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n- Item structure:\n    -- If a specific
      structure is provided for a concept under \"Expected structure,\" you must follow
      that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\n    --
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \"Rating scale,\" the extracted
      item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available labels are provided
      for a concept under \"Available labels,\" the extracted item value must be a
      list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none of the predefined
      labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\n    -- If there are
      example items (\"Extracted concept examples\"), try to follow the same style
      and formatting for your extracted items.\n    -- When extracting string values,
      translate them in English if the original language of the document is not English.\n\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" (found under \"Concept extracted item type\"). Ensure your extracted
      items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string,
      int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n\n- Handling
      missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your
      output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n    -- For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if none
      of the predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \"extracted_items\"
      array empty.\n    -- For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g.,
      {\"labels\": [\"label1\", \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items
      if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\n    -- For concepts that do not have an \"Available labels:\"
      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n- No additional text:\n    --
      Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON array.\n    --
      Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other formatting characters.\n\n======\nANSWER
      FORMAT (MANDATORY):\n[\n    {\n        \"concept_id\": str,\n        \"extracted_items:
      [\n            ...\n        ],\n    },\n    ...\n]\n======\n\n______\nCONCEPTS:\n````\n-
      Concept ID: C0\nConcept name: Contract term\n\nConcept description:\nContract
      term\n\nAmount of extracted items: This concept may have zero, one, or multiple
      extracted items.\n\nConcept extracted item type: int or float\n````\n\n______\n\n------\nDOCUMENT

      in the potential business collaboration.\n\nc. Take all necessary precautions
      to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall
      be no less than the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\n\n4.
      Exclusions from Confidential Information:\n\nConfidential Information does not
      include information that:\n\na. Is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful
      act of the Receiving Party.\n\nb. Is already known to the Receiving Party at
      the time of disclosure.\n\nc. Is lawfully received from a third party without
      breach of this Agreement.\n\nd. Is independently developed by the Receiving
      Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party''s Confidential Information.\n\n6.
      Return of Materials:\n\nUpon termination of this Agreement or upon request,
      the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing Confidential Information
      to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party''s discretion.\n\n5.
      Liability:\n\na. Total Liability Cap:\n The total liability of either party
      for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement, whether
      in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i) $100,000
      or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing Party
      under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of
      liability is cumulative and not per incident.\n\nb. Penalties for Breach:\n
      In the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\n\n7. No License:\n\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving
      Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential
      Information, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.\n\n8. Governing
      Law and Disputes:\n\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
      with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of
      law principles.\n\nAll disputes shall be resolved by the courts of the State
      of California. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of five (5)
      years from the date of signing this agreement.\n\n9. Miscellaneous:\n\na. This
      Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
      to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral
      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\n\nb. Any amendments or
      modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both parties.\n\nc.
      If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, the remainder
      shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision shall
      be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\n\nd. The
      Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\n\nIN WITNESS
      WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement as of
      the date first above written.\n\n_____\nBy: ___________________________\nName:

    body: '{"model": "llama3.1:8b", "prompt": "### System:\nYou will be assigned tasks
      involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various
      types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide
      accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional
      experience and qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments represent
      portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their limited context.
      When working with fragments, focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain
      textual or visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can
      be directly read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document
      that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject
      or theme described in the task. For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item
      breakdowns, or tax details.\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou
      will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance and context
      within the document.\n\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant
      to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader document
      context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from simple
      entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance
      evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n-
      Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments
      based on document content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization
      using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision
      and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\n\n- Visual content analysis: When
      processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine all visual elements carefully,
      including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\n  --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\n  -- Analyze information
      in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual structure
      and relationships.\n\n- Contextual understanding: Consider the full context
      when performing extractions. A single paragraph or sentence may have different
      meanings depending on surrounding content, document type, and domain-specific
      terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  --
      The nature and type of the document\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you
      need to focus on\n  -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n  --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n\n- Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to
      the specified aspects/concepts\n  -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information has been included\n  -- All mandatory
      fields are present and correctly populated\n\n- Conservative approach: When
      in doubt about whether information qualifies for extraction:\n  -- If the relevance
      is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  -- If multiple interpretations are
      possible, choose the most conservative one\n  -- If information is ambiguous,
      do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly
      to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  -- Add extra fields beyond
      what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field names\n  -- Include explanatory
      text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code blocks or formatting markers
      unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n- Structured outputs:
      Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n-
      Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications
      or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\n\n### User:\nBelow you will find document text and a list of
      concepts.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2.
      Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document
      text.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.\n\nFollow
      these additional rules:\n\n- Output format:\nProvide your answer in only the
      following answer format (do not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory
      text).\n\n- Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two
      keys: \"concept_id\" and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\"
      must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    --
      The value of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed
      or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified under \"Amount
      of extracted items\". Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be
      part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n- Item structure:\n    -- If a specific
      structure is provided for a concept under \"Expected structure,\" you must follow
      that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\n    --
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \"Rating scale,\" the extracted
      item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available labels are provided
      for a concept under \"Available labels,\" the extracted item value must be a
      list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none of the predefined
      labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\n    -- If there are
      example items (\"Extracted concept examples\"), try to follow the same style
      and formatting for your extracted items.\n    -- When extracting string values,
      translate them in English if the original language of the document is not English.\n\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" (found under \"Concept extracted item type\"). Ensure your extracted
      items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string,
      int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n\n- Handling
      missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your
      output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n    -- For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if none
      of the predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \"extracted_items\"
      array empty.\n    -- For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g.,
      {\"labels\": [\"label1\", \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items
      if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\n    -- For concepts that do not have an \"Available labels:\"
      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n- No additional text:\n    --
      Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON array.\n    --
      Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other formatting characters.\n\n======\nANSWER

      copyrights and copyright applications, trademarks and trademark applications),
      (6) strategic information (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses
      and strategies). Software code shall also be included into the confidential
      information.\n\nConfidential Information shall not include information that:
      (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of
      disclosure by Receiving Party or its Representatives; (b) was available to Receiving
      Party on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party;

      obligation to Disclosing Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving
      Party without reference to or use of any Confidential Information. The name
      of the dog of the Receiving Party is Bob.\nThe designation of information as
      Confidential Information shall not be determinative of whether such information
      constitutes a trade secret under applicable law. All Confidential Information
      shall remain the exclusive property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party
      shall have no rights, by license or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information
      except as expressly provided herein.\n\n3. Obligations of Receiving Party:\n\nThe
      party receiving Confidential Information (\"Receiving Party\") shall:\n\na.
      Maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and not disclose
      it to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\n\nb.
      Use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging
      in the potential business collaboration.\n\nc. Take all necessary precautions
      to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall
      be no less than the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\n\n4.

      include information that:\n\na. Is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful
      act of the Receiving Party.\n\nb. Is already known to the Receiving Party at
      the time of disclosure.\n\nc. Is lawfully received from a third party without
      breach of this Agreement.\n\nd. Is independently developed by the Receiving
      Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party''s Confidential Information.\n\n6.

      the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing Confidential Information
      to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party''s discretion.\n\n5.
      Liability:\n\na. Total Liability Cap:\n The total liability of either party
      for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement, whether
      in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i) $100,000
      or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing Party
      under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of
      liability is cumulative and not per incident.\n\nb. Penalties for Breach:\n
      In the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\n\n7. No License:\n\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving
      Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential

      years from the date of signing this agreement.\n\n9. Miscellaneous:\n\na. This
      Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
      to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral
      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\n\nb. Any amendments or
      modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both parties.\n\nc.
      If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, the remainder
      shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision shall
      be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\n\nd. The
      Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\n\nIN WITNESS
      WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement as of
      the date first above written.\n\n_____\nBy: ___________________________\nName:

    body: '{"model": "llama3.1:8b", "prompt": "### System:\nYou will be assigned tasks
      involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various
      types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide
      accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional
      experience and qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments represent
      portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their limited context.
      When working with fragments, focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain
      textual or visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can
      be directly read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document
      that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject
      or theme described in the task. For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item
      breakdowns, or tax details.\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou
      will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance and context
      within the document.\n\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant
      to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader document
      context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from simple
      entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance
      evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n-
      Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments
      based on document content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization
      using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision
      and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\n\n- Visual content analysis: When
      processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine all visual elements carefully,
      including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\n  --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\n  -- Analyze information
      in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual structure
      and relationships.\n\n- Contextual understanding: Consider the full context
      when performing extractions. A single paragraph or sentence may have different
      meanings depending on surrounding content, document type, and domain-specific
      terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  --
      The nature and type of the document\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you
      need to focus on\n  -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n  --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n\n- Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to
      the specified aspects/concepts\n  -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information has been included\n  -- All mandatory
      fields are present and correctly populated\n\n- Conservative approach: When
      in doubt about whether information qualifies for extraction:\n  -- If the relevance
      is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  -- If multiple interpretations are
      possible, choose the most conservative one\n  -- If information is ambiguous,
      do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly
      to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  -- Add extra fields beyond
      what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field names\n  -- Include explanatory
      text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code blocks or formatting markers
      unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n- Structured outputs:
      Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n-
      Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications
      or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\n\n### User:\nBelow you will find a list of consecutively ordered
      paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your task is to:\n\n1. Read
      and understand the aspects\n- Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for
      example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\n- Aspects
      describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\n\n2.
      Examine each paragraph\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for
      example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n- You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\n- A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none
      of the aspects.\n- If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the
      aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the aspect''s
      list of paragraph IDs.\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not
      include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final answer in the
      specified JSON format\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object
      corresponding to a single aspect.\n- For each aspect (in the order they are
      provided), include:\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g.,
      \"A0\".\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array of the paragraph IDs that address or
      relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\", \"P2\"].\n    -- If an aspect has no related
      paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not
      add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the
      JSON array.\n\nUse the following answer format as a guide for your final answer
      (remember: no surrounding text or ```json delimiters should be included).\n\n======\nANSWER

    body: '{"model": "llama3.1:8b", "prompt": "### System:\nYou will be assigned tasks
      involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various
      types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide
      accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional
      experience and qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments represent
      portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their limited context.
      When working with fragments, focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain
      textual or visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can
      be directly read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document
      that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject
      or theme described in the task. For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item
      breakdowns, or tax details.\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou
      will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance and context
      within the document.\n\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant
      to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader document
      context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from simple
      entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance
      evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n-
      Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments
      based on document content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization
      using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision
      and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\n\n- Visual content analysis: When
      processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine all visual elements carefully,
      including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\n  --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\n  -- Analyze information
      in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual structure
      and relationships.\n\n- Contextual understanding: Consider the full context
      when performing extractions. A single paragraph or sentence may have different
      meanings depending on surrounding content, document type, and domain-specific
      terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  --
      The nature and type of the document\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you
      need to focus on\n  -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n  --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n\n- Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to
      the specified aspects/concepts\n  -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information has been included\n  -- All mandatory
      fields are present and correctly populated\n\n- Conservative approach: When
      in doubt about whether information qualifies for extraction:\n  -- If the relevance
      is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  -- If multiple interpretations are
      possible, choose the most conservative one\n  -- If information is ambiguous,
      do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly
      to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  -- Add extra fields beyond
      what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field names\n  -- Include explanatory
      text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code blocks or formatting markers
      unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n- Structured outputs:
      Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n-
      Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications
      or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\n\n### User:\nBelow you will find a list of consecutively ordered
      paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your task is to:\n\n1. Read
      and understand the aspects\n- Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for
      example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\n- Aspects
      describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\n\n2.
      Examine each paragraph\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for
      example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n- You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\n- A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none
      of the aspects.\n- If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the
      aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the aspect''s
      list of paragraph IDs.\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not
      include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final answer in the
      specified JSON format\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object
      corresponding to a single aspect.\n- For each aspect (in the order they are
      provided), include:\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g.,
      \"A0\".\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array of the paragraph IDs that address or
      relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\", \"P2\"].\n    -- If an aspect has no related
      paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not
      add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the
      JSON array.\n\nUse the following answer format as a guide for your final answer
      (remember: no surrounding text or ```json delimiters should be included).\n\n======\nANSWER

    body: '{"model": "llama3.1:8b", "prompt": "### System:\nYou will be assigned tasks
      involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various
      types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide
      accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional
      experience and qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments represent
      portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their limited context.
      When working with fragments, focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain
      textual or visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can
      be directly read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document
      that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject
      or theme described in the task. For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item
      breakdowns, or tax details.\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou
      will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance and context
      within the document.\n\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant
      to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader document
      context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from simple
      entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance
      evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n-
      Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments
      based on document content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization
      using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision
      and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\n\n- Visual content analysis: When
      processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine all visual elements carefully,
      including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\n  --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\n  -- Analyze information
      in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual structure
      and relationships.\n\n- Contextual understanding: Consider the full context
      when performing extractions. A single paragraph or sentence may have different
      meanings depending on surrounding content, document type, and domain-specific
      terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  --
      The nature and type of the document\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you
      need to focus on\n  -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n  --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n\n- Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to
      the specified aspects/concepts\n  -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information has been included\n  -- All mandatory
      fields are present and correctly populated\n\n- Conservative approach: When
      in doubt about whether information qualifies for extraction:\n  -- If the relevance
      is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  -- If multiple interpretations are
      possible, choose the most conservative one\n  -- If information is ambiguous,
      do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly
      to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  -- Add extra fields beyond
      what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field names\n  -- Include explanatory
      text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code blocks or formatting markers
      unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n- Structured outputs:
      Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n-
      Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications
      or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\n\n### User:\nBelow you will find a list of consecutively ordered
      paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your task is to:\n\n1. Read
      and understand the aspects\n- Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for
      example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\n- Aspects
      describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\n\n2.
      Examine each paragraph\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for
      example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n- You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\n- A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none
      of the aspects.\n- If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the
      aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the aspect''s
      list of paragraph IDs.\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not
      include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final answer in the
      specified JSON format\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object
      corresponding to a single aspect.\n- For each aspect (in the order they are
      provided), include:\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g.,
      \"A0\".\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array of the paragraph IDs that address or
      relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\", \"P2\"].\n    -- If an aspect has no related
      paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not
      add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the
      JSON array.\n\nUse the following answer format as a guide for your final answer
      (remember: no surrounding text or ```json delimiters should be included).\n\n======\nANSWER

    body: '{"model": "llama3.1:8b", "prompt": "### System:\nYou will be assigned tasks
      involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various
      types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide
      accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional
      experience and qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments represent
      portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their limited context.
      When working with fragments, focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain
      textual or visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can
      be directly read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document
      that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject
      or theme described in the task. For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item
      breakdowns, or tax details.\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou
      will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance and context
      within the document.\n\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant
      to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader document
      context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from simple
      entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance
      evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n-
      Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments
      based on document content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization
      using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision
      and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\n\n- Visual content analysis: When
      processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine all visual elements carefully,
      including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\n  --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\n  -- Analyze information
      in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual structure
      and relationships.\n\n- Contextual understanding: Consider the full context
      when performing extractions. A single paragraph or sentence may have different
      meanings depending on surrounding content, document type, and domain-specific
      terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  --
      The nature and type of the document\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you
      need to focus on\n  -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n  --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n\n- Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to
      the specified aspects/concepts\n  -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information has been included\n  -- All mandatory
      fields are present and correctly populated\n\n- Conservative approach: When
      in doubt about whether information qualifies for extraction:\n  -- If the relevance
      is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  -- If multiple interpretations are
      possible, choose the most conservative one\n  -- If information is ambiguous,
      do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly
      to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  -- Add extra fields beyond
      what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field names\n  -- Include explanatory
      text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code blocks or formatting markers
      unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n- Structured outputs:
      Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n-
      Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications
      or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\n\n### User:\nBelow you will find a list of consecutively ordered
      paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your task is to:\n\n1. Read
      and understand the aspects\n- Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for
      example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\n- Aspects
      describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\n\n2.
      Examine each paragraph\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for
      example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n- You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\n- A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none
      of the aspects.\n- If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the
      aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the aspect''s
      list of paragraph IDs.\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not
      include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final answer in the
      specified JSON format\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object
      corresponding to a single aspect.\n- For each aspect (in the order they are
      provided), include:\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g.,
      \"A0\".\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array of the paragraph IDs that address or
      relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\", \"P2\"].\n    -- If an aspect has no related
      paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not
      add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the
      JSON array.\n\nUse the following answer format as a guide for your final answer
      (remember: no surrounding text or ```json delimiters should be included).\n\n======\nANSWER

      involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various
      types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide
      accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional
      experience and qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments represent
      portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their limited context.
      When working with fragments, focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain
      textual or visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can
      be directly read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document
      that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject
      or theme described in the task. For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item
      breakdowns, or tax details.\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou
      will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance and context
      within the document.\n\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant
      to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader document
      context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from simple
      entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance
      evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n-
      Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments
      based on document content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization
      using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision
      and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\n\n- Visual content analysis: When
      processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine all visual elements carefully,
      including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\n  --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\n  -- Analyze information
      in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual structure
      and relationships.\n\n- Contextual understanding: Consider the full context
      when performing extractions. A single paragraph or sentence may have different
      meanings depending on surrounding content, document type, and domain-specific
      terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  --
      The nature and type of the document\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you
      need to focus on\n  -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n  --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n\n- Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to
      the specified aspects/concepts\n  -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information has been included\n  -- All mandatory
      fields are present and correctly populated\n\n- Conservative approach: When
      in doubt about whether information qualifies for extraction:\n  -- If the relevance
      is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  -- If multiple interpretations are
      possible, choose the most conservative one\n  -- If information is ambiguous,
      do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly
      to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  -- Add extra fields beyond
      what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field names\n  -- Include explanatory
      text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code blocks or formatting markers
      unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n- Structured outputs:
      Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n-
      Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications
      or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\n\n### User:\nBelow you will find document text and a list of
      concepts.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2.
      Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document
      text.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.\n\nFollow
      these additional rules:\n\n- Output format:\nProvide your answer in only the
      following answer format (do not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory
      text).\n\n- Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two
      keys: \"concept_id\" and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\"
      must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    --
      The value of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed
      or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified under \"Amount
      of extracted items\". Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be
      part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n- Item structure:\n    -- If a specific
      structure is provided for a concept under \"Expected structure,\" you must follow
      that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\n    --
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \"Rating scale,\" the extracted
      item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available labels are provided
      for a concept under \"Available labels,\" the extracted item value must be a
      list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none of the predefined
      labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\n    -- If there are
      example items (\"Extracted concept examples\"), try to follow the same style
      and formatting for your extracted items.\n    -- When extracting string values,
      translate them in English if the original language of the document is not English.\n\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" (found under \"Concept extracted item type\"). Ensure your extracted
      items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string,
      int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n\n- Handling
      missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your
      output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n    -- For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if none
      of the predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \"extracted_items\"
      array empty.\n    -- For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g.,
      {\"labels\": [\"label1\", \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items
      if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\n    -- For concepts that do not have an \"Available labels:\"
      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n- No additional text:\n    --
      Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON array.\n    --
      Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other formatting characters.\n\n======\nANSWER

      obligation to Disclosing Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving
      Party without reference to or use of any Confidential Information. The name
      of the dog of the Receiving Party is Bob.\nThe designation of information as
      Confidential Information shall not be determinative of whether such information
      constitutes a trade secret under applicable law. All Confidential Information
      shall remain the exclusive property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party
      shall have no rights, by license or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information
      except as expressly provided herein.\n\n3. Obligations of Receiving Party:\n\nThe
      party receiving Confidential Information (\"Receiving Party\") shall:\n\na.
      Maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and not disclose
      it to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\n\nb.
      Use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging
      in the potential business collaboration.\n\nc. Take all necessary precautions
      to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall
      be no less than the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\n\n4.

      include information that:\n\na. Is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful
      act of the Receiving Party.\n\nb. Is already known to the Receiving Party at
      the time of disclosure.\n\nc. Is lawfully received from a third party without
      breach of this Agreement.\n\nd. Is independently developed by the Receiving

      to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party''s discretion.\n\n5.
      Liability:\n\na. Total Liability Cap:\n The total liability of either party
      for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement, whether
      in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i) $100,000
      or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing Party
      under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of

      In the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\n\n7. No License:\n\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving
      Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential

      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\n\nb. Any amendments or
      modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both parties.\n\nc.
      If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, the remainder
      shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision shall
      be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\n\nd. The
      Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\n\nIN WITNESS
      WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement as of

    body: '{"model": "llama3.1:8b", "prompt": "### System:\nYou will be assigned tasks
      involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various
      types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide
      accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional
      experience and qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments represent
      portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their limited context.
      When working with fragments, focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain
      textual or visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can
      be directly read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document
      that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject
      or theme described in the task. For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item
      breakdowns, or tax details.\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou
      will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance and context
      within the document.\n\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant
      to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader document
      context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from simple
      entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance
      evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n-
      Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments
      based on document content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization
      using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision
      and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\n\n- Visual content analysis: When
      processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine all visual elements carefully,
      including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\n  --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\n  -- Analyze information
      in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual structure
      and relationships.\n\n- Contextual understanding: Consider the full context
      when performing extractions. A single paragraph or sentence may have different
      meanings depending on surrounding content, document type, and domain-specific
      terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  --
      The nature and type of the document\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you
      need to focus on\n  -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n  --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n\n- Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to
      the specified aspects/concepts\n  -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information has been included\n  -- All mandatory
      fields are present and correctly populated\n\n- Conservative approach: When
      in doubt about whether information qualifies for extraction:\n  -- If the relevance
      is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  -- If multiple interpretations are
      possible, choose the most conservative one\n  -- If information is ambiguous,
      do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly
      to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  -- Add extra fields beyond
      what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field names\n  -- Include explanatory
      text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code blocks or formatting markers
      unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n- Structured outputs:
      Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n-
      Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications
      or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\n\n### User:\nBelow you will find document text and a list of
      concepts.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2.
      Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document
      text.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.\n\nFollow
      these additional rules:\n\n- Output format:\nProvide your answer in only the
      following answer format (do not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory
      text).\n\n- Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two
      keys: \"concept_id\" and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\"
      must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    --
      The value of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed
      or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified under \"Amount
      of extracted items\". Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be
      part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n- Item structure:\n    -- If a specific
      structure is provided for a concept under \"Expected structure,\" you must follow
      that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\n    --
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \"Rating scale,\" the extracted
      item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available labels are provided
      for a concept under \"Available labels,\" the extracted item value must be a
      list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none of the predefined
      labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\n    -- If there are
      example items (\"Extracted concept examples\"), try to follow the same style
      and formatting for your extracted items.\n    -- When extracting string values,
      translate them in English if the original language of the document is not English.\n\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" (found under \"Concept extracted item type\"). Ensure your extracted
      items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string,
      int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n\n- Handling
      missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your
      output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n    -- For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if none
      of the predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \"extracted_items\"
      array empty.\n    -- For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g.,
      {\"labels\": [\"label1\", \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items
      if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\n    -- For concepts that do not have an \"Available labels:\"
      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n- No additional text:\n    --
      Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON array.\n    --
      Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other formatting characters.\n\n======\nANSWER
      FORMAT (MANDATORY):\n[\n    {\n        \"concept_id\": str,\n        \"extracted_items:
      [\n            ...\n        ],\n    },\n    ...\n]\n======\n\n______\nCONCEPTS:\n````\n-

      obligation to Disclosing Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving
      Party without reference to or use of any Confidential Information. The name
      of the dog of the Receiving Party is Bob.\nThe designation of information as
      Confidential Information shall not be determinative of whether such information
      constitutes a trade secret under applicable law. All Confidential Information
      shall remain the exclusive property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party
      shall have no rights, by license or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information
      except as expressly provided herein.\n\n3. Obligations of Receiving Party:\n\nThe
      party receiving Confidential Information (\"Receiving Party\") shall:\n\na.
      Maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and not disclose
      it to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\n\nb.
      Use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging
      in the potential business collaboration.\n\nc. Take all necessary precautions
      to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall
      be no less than the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\n\n4.
      Exclusions from Confidential Information:\n\nConfidential Information does not
      include information that:\n\na. Is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful
      act of the Receiving Party.\n\nb. Is already known to the Receiving Party at
      the time of disclosure.\n\nc. Is lawfully received from a third party without
      breach of this Agreement.\n\nd. Is independently developed by the Receiving
      Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party''s Confidential Information.\n\n6.

      the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing Confidential Information
      to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party''s discretion.\n\n5.
      Liability:\n\na. Total Liability Cap:\n The total liability of either party
      for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement, whether
      in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i) $100,000
      or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing Party
      under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of
      liability is cumulative and not per incident.\n\nb. Penalties for Breach:\n
      In the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\n\n7. No License:\n\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving
      Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential

      years from the date of signing this agreement.\n\n9. Miscellaneous:\n\na. This
      Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
      to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral
      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\n\nb. Any amendments or
      modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both parties.\n\nc.
      If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, the remainder
      shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision shall
      be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\n\nd. The
      Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\n\nIN WITNESS

      involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various
      types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide
      accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional
      experience and qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments represent
      portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their limited context.
      When working with fragments, focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain
      textual or visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can
      be directly read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document
      that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject
      or theme described in the task. For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item
      breakdowns, or tax details.\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou
      will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance and context
      within the document.\n\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant
      to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader document
      context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from simple
      entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance
      evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n-
      Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments
      based on document content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization
      using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision
      and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\n\n- Visual content analysis: When
      processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine all visual elements carefully,
      including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\n  --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\n  -- Analyze information
      in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual structure
      and relationships.\n\n- Contextual understanding: Consider the full context
      when performing extractions. A single paragraph or sentence may have different
      meanings depending on surrounding content, document type, and domain-specific
      terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  --
      The nature and type of the document\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you
      need to focus on\n  -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n  --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n\n- Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to
      the specified aspects/concepts\n  -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information has been included\n  -- All mandatory
      fields are present and correctly populated\n\n- Conservative approach: When
      in doubt about whether information qualifies for extraction:\n  -- If the relevance
      is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  -- If multiple interpretations are
      possible, choose the most conservative one\n  -- If information is ambiguous,
      do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly
      to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  -- Add extra fields beyond
      what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field names\n  -- Include explanatory
      text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code blocks or formatting markers
      unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n- Structured outputs:
      Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n-
      Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications
      or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\n\n### User:\nBelow you will find a list of consecutively ordered
      paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your task is to:\n\n1. Read
      and understand the aspects\n- Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for
      example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\n- Aspects
      describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\n\n2.
      Examine each paragraph\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for
      example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n- You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\n- A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none
      of the aspects.\n- If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the
      aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the aspect''s
      list of paragraph IDs.\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not
      include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final answer in the
      specified JSON format\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object
      corresponding to a single aspect.\n- For each aspect (in the order they are
      provided), include:\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g.,
      \"A0\".\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array of the paragraph IDs that address or
      relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\", \"P2\"].\n    -- If an aspect has no related
      paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not
      add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the
      JSON array.\n\nUse the following answer format as a guide for your final answer
      (remember: no surrounding text or ```json delimiters should be included).\n\n======\nANSWER

    body: '{"model": "llama3.1:8b", "prompt": "### System:\nYou will be assigned tasks
      involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various
      types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide
      accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional
      experience and qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments represent
      portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their limited context.
      When working with fragments, focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain
      textual or visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can
      be directly read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document
      that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject
      or theme described in the task. For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item
      breakdowns, or tax details.\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou
      will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance and context
      within the document.\n\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant
      to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader document
      context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from simple
      entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance
      evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n-
      Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments
      based on document content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization
      using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision
      and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\n\n- Visual content analysis: When
      processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine all visual elements carefully,
      including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\n  --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\n  -- Analyze information
      in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual structure
      and relationships.\n\n- Contextual understanding: Consider the full context
      when performing extractions. A single paragraph or sentence may have different
      meanings depending on surrounding content, document type, and domain-specific
      terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  --
      The nature and type of the document\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you
      need to focus on\n  -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n  --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n\n- Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to
      the specified aspects/concepts\n  -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information has been included\n  -- All mandatory
      fields are present and correctly populated\n\n- Conservative approach: When
      in doubt about whether information qualifies for extraction:\n  -- If the relevance
      is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  -- If multiple interpretations are
      possible, choose the most conservative one\n  -- If information is ambiguous,
      do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly
      to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  -- Add extra fields beyond
      what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field names\n  -- Include explanatory
      text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code blocks or formatting markers
      unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n- Structured outputs:
      Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n-
      Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications
      or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\n\n### User:\nBelow you will find a list of consecutively ordered
      paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your task is to:\n\n1. Read
      and understand the aspects\n- Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for
      example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\n- Aspects
      describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\n\n2.
      Examine each paragraph\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for
      example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n- You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\n- A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none
      of the aspects.\n- If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the
      aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the aspect''s
      list of paragraph IDs.\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not
      include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final answer in the
      specified JSON format\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object
      corresponding to a single aspect.\n- For each aspect (in the order they are
      provided), include:\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g.,
      \"A0\".\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array of the paragraph IDs that address or
      relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\", \"P2\"].\n    -- If an aspect has no related
      paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not
      add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the
      JSON array.\n\nUse the following answer format as a guide for your final answer
      (remember: no surrounding text or ```json delimiters should be included).\n\n======\nANSWER
      FORMAT (MANDATORY):\n[\n    {\n        \"aspect_id\": str,\n        \"paragraph_ids:

    body: '{"model": "llama3.1:8b", "prompt": "### System:\nYou will be assigned tasks
      involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various
      types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide
      accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional
      experience and qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments represent
      portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their limited context.
      When working with fragments, focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain
      textual or visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can
      be directly read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document
      that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject
      or theme described in the task. For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item
      breakdowns, or tax details.\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou
      will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance and context
      within the document.\n\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant
      to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader document
      context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from simple
      entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance
      evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n-
      Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments
      based on document content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization
      using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision
      and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\n\n- Visual content analysis: When
      processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine all visual elements carefully,
      including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\n  --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\n  -- Analyze information
      in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual structure
      and relationships.\n\n- Contextual understanding: Consider the full context
      when performing extractions. A single paragraph or sentence may have different
      meanings depending on surrounding content, document type, and domain-specific
      terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  --
      The nature and type of the document\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you
      need to focus on\n  -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n  --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n\n- Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to
      the specified aspects/concepts\n  -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information has been included\n  -- All mandatory
      fields are present and correctly populated\n\n- Conservative approach: When
      in doubt about whether information qualifies for extraction:\n  -- If the relevance
      is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  -- If multiple interpretations are
      possible, choose the most conservative one\n  -- If information is ambiguous,
      do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly
      to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  -- Add extra fields beyond
      what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field names\n  -- Include explanatory
      text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code blocks or formatting markers
      unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n- Structured outputs:
      Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n-
      Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications
      or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\n\n### User:\nBelow you will find a list of consecutively ordered
      paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your task is to:\n\n1. Read
      and understand the aspects\n- Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for
      example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\n- Aspects
      describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\n\n2.
      Examine each paragraph\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for
      example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n- You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\n- A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none
      of the aspects.\n- If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the
      aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the aspect''s
      list of paragraph IDs.\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not
      include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final answer in the
      specified JSON format\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object
      corresponding to a single aspect.\n- For each aspect (in the order they are
      provided), include:\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g.,
      \"A0\".\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array of the paragraph IDs that address or
      relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\", \"P2\"].\n    -- If an aspect has no related
      paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not
      add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the
      JSON array.\n\nUse the following answer format as a guide for your final answer
      (remember: no surrounding text or ```json delimiters should be included).\n\n======\nANSWER

        Explanation of Code Implementation\n\nThe provided code defines a class `NDA`
        to encapsulate the key points related to liability in the Non-Disclosure Agreement.
        The class has two methods: `get_total_liability_cap()` and `get_penalties_for_breach()`,
        which return the total liability cap and penalties for breach, respectively.\n\nThis
        implementation provides a clear and concise way to access and utilize the
        information related to liability in the NDA.", "done": true, "done_reason":

    body: '{"model": "llama3.1:8b", "prompt": "### System:\nYou will be assigned tasks
      involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various
      types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide
      accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional
      experience and qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments represent
      portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their limited context.
      When working with fragments, focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain
      textual or visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can
      be directly read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document
      that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject
      or theme described in the task. For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item
      breakdowns, or tax details.\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou
      will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance and context
      within the document.\n\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant
      to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader document
      context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from simple
      entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance
      evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n-
      Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments
      based on document content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization
      using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision
      and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\n\n- Visual content analysis: When
      processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine all visual elements carefully,
      including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\n  --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\n  -- Analyze information
      in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual structure
      and relationships.\n\n- Contextual understanding: Consider the full context
      when performing extractions. A single paragraph or sentence may have different
      meanings depending on surrounding content, document type, and domain-specific
      terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  --
      The nature and type of the document\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you
      need to focus on\n  -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n  --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n\n- Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to
      the specified aspects/concepts\n  -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information has been included\n  -- All mandatory
      fields are present and correctly populated\n\n- Conservative approach: When
      in doubt about whether information qualifies for extraction:\n  -- If the relevance
      is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  -- If multiple interpretations are
      possible, choose the most conservative one\n  -- If information is ambiguous,
      do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly
      to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  -- Add extra fields beyond
      what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field names\n  -- Include explanatory
      text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code blocks or formatting markers
      unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n- Structured outputs:
      Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n-
      Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications
      or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\n\n### User:\nBelow you will find document text and a list of
      concepts.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2.
      Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document
      text.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.\n\nFollow
      these additional rules:\n\n- Output format:\nProvide your answer in only the
      following answer format (do not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory
      text).\n\n- Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two
      keys: \"concept_id\" and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\"
      must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    --
      The value of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed
      or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified under \"Amount
      of extracted items\". Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be
      part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n- Item structure:\n    -- If a specific
      structure is provided for a concept under \"Expected structure,\" you must follow
      that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\n    --
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \"Rating scale,\" the extracted
      item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available labels are provided
      for a concept under \"Available labels,\" the extracted item value must be a
      list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none of the predefined
      labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\n    -- If there are
      example items (\"Extracted concept examples\"), try to follow the same style
      and formatting for your extracted items.\n    -- When extracting string values,
      translate them in English if the original language of the document is not English.\n\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" (found under \"Concept extracted item type\"). Ensure your extracted
      items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string,
      int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n\n- Handling
      missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your
      output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n    -- For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if none
      of the predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \"extracted_items\"
      array empty.\n    -- For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g.,
      {\"labels\": [\"label1\", \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items
      if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\n    -- For concepts that do not have an \"Available labels:\"
      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n- No additional text:\n    --
      Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON array.\n    --
      Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other formatting characters.\n\n======\nANSWER
      FORMAT (MANDATORY):\n[\n    {\n        \"concept_id\": str,\n        \"extracted_items:
      [\n            ...\n        ],\n    },\n    ...\n]\n======\n\n______\nCONCEPTS:\n````\n-
      Concept ID: C0\nConcept name: Contract term\n\nConcept description:\nContract

      obligation to Disclosing Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving
      Party without reference to or use of any Confidential Information. The name
      of the dog of the Receiving Party is Bob.\nThe designation of information as
      Confidential Information shall not be determinative of whether such information
      constitutes a trade secret under applicable law. All Confidential Information
      shall remain the exclusive property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party
      shall have no rights, by license or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information
      except as expressly provided herein.\n\n3. Obligations of Receiving Party:\n\nThe
      party receiving Confidential Information (\"Receiving Party\") shall:\n\na.
      Maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and not disclose
      it to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\n\nb.
      Use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging
      in the potential business collaboration.\n\nc. Take all necessary precautions
      to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall
      be no less than the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\n\n4.
      Exclusions from Confidential Information:\n\nConfidential Information does not
      include information that:\n\na. Is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful
      act of the Receiving Party.\n\nb. Is already known to the Receiving Party at
      the time of disclosure.\n\nc. Is lawfully received from a third party without
      breach of this Agreement.\n\nd. Is independently developed by the Receiving
      Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party''s Confidential Information.\n\n6.

      the Receiving Party shall return all materials containing Confidential Information
      to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party''s discretion.\n\n5.
      Liability:\n\na. Total Liability Cap:\n The total liability of either party
      for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement, whether
      in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i) $100,000
      or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing Party
      under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of

      In the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\n\n7. No License:\n\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving
      Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential

      years from the date of signing this agreement.\n\n9. Miscellaneous:\n\na. This
      Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
      to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral
      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\n\nb. Any amendments or
      modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both parties.\n\nc.
      If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, the remainder
      shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision shall
      be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\n\nd. The
      Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\n\nIN WITNESS
      WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement as of
      the date first above written.\n\n_____\nBy: ___________________________\nName:

    body: '{"model": "llama3.1:8b", "prompt": "### System:\nYou will be assigned tasks
      involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various
      types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide
      accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional
      experience and qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments represent
      portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their limited context.
      When working with fragments, focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain
      textual or visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can
      be directly read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document
      that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject
      or theme described in the task. For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item
      breakdowns, or tax details.\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou
      will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance and context
      within the document.\n\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant
      to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader document
      context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from simple
      entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance
      evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n-
      Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments
      based on document content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization
      using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision
      and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\n\n- Visual content analysis: When
      processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine all visual elements carefully,
      including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\n  --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\n  -- Analyze information
      in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual structure
      and relationships.\n\n- Contextual understanding: Consider the full context
      when performing extractions. A single paragraph or sentence may have different
      meanings depending on surrounding content, document type, and domain-specific
      terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  --
      The nature and type of the document\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you
      need to focus on\n  -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n  --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n\n- Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to
      the specified aspects/concepts\n  -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information has been included\n  -- All mandatory
      fields are present and correctly populated\n\n- Conservative approach: When
      in doubt about whether information qualifies for extraction:\n  -- If the relevance
      is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  -- If multiple interpretations are
      possible, choose the most conservative one\n  -- If information is ambiguous,
      do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly
      to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  -- Add extra fields beyond
      what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field names\n  -- Include explanatory
      text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code blocks or formatting markers
      unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n- Structured outputs:
      Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n-
      Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications
      or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\n\n### User:\nBelow you will find a list of consecutively ordered
      paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your task is to:\n\n1. Read
      and understand the aspects\n- Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for
      example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\n- Aspects
      describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\n\n2.
      Examine each paragraph\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for
      example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n- You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\n- A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none
      of the aspects.\n- If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the
      aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the aspect''s
      list of paragraph IDs.\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not
      include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final answer in the
      specified JSON format\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object
      corresponding to a single aspect.\n- For each aspect (in the order they are
      provided), include:\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g.,
      \"A0\".\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array of the paragraph IDs that address or
      relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\", \"P2\"].\n    -- If an aspect has no related
      paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not
      add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the
      JSON array.\n\nUse the following answer format as a guide for your final answer

    body: '{"model": "llama3.1:8b", "prompt": "### System:\nYou will be assigned tasks
      involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various
      types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide
      accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional
      experience and qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments represent
      portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their limited context.
      When working with fragments, focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain
      textual or visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can
      be directly read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document
      that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject
      or theme described in the task. For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item
      breakdowns, or tax details.\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou
      will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance and context
      within the document.\n\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant
      to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader document
      context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from simple
      entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance
      evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n-
      Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments
      based on document content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization
      using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision
      and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\n\n- Visual content analysis: When
      processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine all visual elements carefully,
      including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\n  --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\n  -- Analyze information
      in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual structure
      and relationships.\n\n- Contextual understanding: Consider the full context
      when performing extractions. A single paragraph or sentence may have different
      meanings depending on surrounding content, document type, and domain-specific
      terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  --
      The nature and type of the document\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you
      need to focus on\n  -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n  --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n\n- Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to
      the specified aspects/concepts\n  -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information has been included\n  -- All mandatory
      fields are present and correctly populated\n\n- Conservative approach: When
      in doubt about whether information qualifies for extraction:\n  -- If the relevance
      is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  -- If multiple interpretations are
      possible, choose the most conservative one\n  -- If information is ambiguous,
      do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly
      to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  -- Add extra fields beyond
      what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field names\n  -- Include explanatory
      text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code blocks or formatting markers
      unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n- Structured outputs:
      Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n-
      Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications
      or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\n\n### User:\nBelow you will find a list of consecutively ordered
      paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your task is to:\n\n1. Read
      and understand the aspects\n- Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for
      example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\n- Aspects
      describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\n\n2.
      Examine each paragraph\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for
      example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n- You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\n- A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none
      of the aspects.\n- If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the
      aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the aspect''s
      list of paragraph IDs.\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not
      include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final answer in the
      specified JSON format\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object
      corresponding to a single aspect.\n- For each aspect (in the order they are
      provided), include:\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g.,
      \"A0\".\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array of the paragraph IDs that address or
      relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\", \"P2\"].\n    -- If an aspect has no related
      paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not
      add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the
      JSON array.\n\nUse the following answer format as a guide for your final answer
      (remember: no surrounding text or ```json delimiters should be included).\n\n======\nANSWER

    body: '{"model": "llama3.1:8b", "prompt": "### System:\nYou will be assigned tasks
      involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various
      types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide
      accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional
      experience and qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments represent
      portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their limited context.
      When working with fragments, focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain
      textual or visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can
      be directly read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document
      that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject
      or theme described in the task. For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item
      breakdowns, or tax details.\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou
      will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance and context
      within the document.\n\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant
      to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader document
      context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from simple
      entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance
      evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n-
      Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments
      based on document content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization
      using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision
      and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\n\n- Visual content analysis: When
      processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine all visual elements carefully,
      including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\n  --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\n  -- Analyze information
      in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual structure
      and relationships.\n\n- Contextual understanding: Consider the full context
      when performing extractions. A single paragraph or sentence may have different
      meanings depending on surrounding content, document type, and domain-specific
      terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  --
      The nature and type of the document\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you
      need to focus on\n  -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n  --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n\n- Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to
      the specified aspects/concepts\n  -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information has been included\n  -- All mandatory
      fields are present and correctly populated\n\n- Conservative approach: When
      in doubt about whether information qualifies for extraction:\n  -- If the relevance
      is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  -- If multiple interpretations are
      possible, choose the most conservative one\n  -- If information is ambiguous,
      do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly
      to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  -- Add extra fields beyond
      what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field names\n  -- Include explanatory
      text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code blocks or formatting markers
      unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n- Structured outputs:
      Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n-
      Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications
      or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\n\n### User:\nBelow you will find document text and a list of
      concepts.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Read through the document text provided.\n2.
      Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed within the document
      text.\n3. For each concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant
      to that concept. The item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4.
      Produce a JSON array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n\nIf
      a concept is not addressed in the document text, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.\n\nFollow
      these additional rules:\n\n- Output format:\nProvide your answer in only the
      following answer format (do not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory
      text).\n\n- Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two
      keys: \"concept_id\" and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\"
      must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    --
      The value of \"extracted_items\" must be an array. If the concept is not addressed
      or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\n        --- Extracted
      items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from the content
      (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        --- Guidance regarding
      the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is specified under \"Amount
      of extracted items\". Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be
      part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n- Item structure:\n    -- If a specific
      structure is provided for a concept under \"Expected structure,\" you must follow
      that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\n    --
      If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \"Rating scale,\" the extracted
      item value must be within that scale.\n    -- If available labels are provided
      for a concept under \"Available labels,\" the extracted item value must be a
      list containing only labels from the predefined set. If none of the predefined
      labels apply, do not extract any items for that concept.\n    -- If there are
      example items (\"Extracted concept examples\"), try to follow the same style
      and formatting for your extracted items.\n    -- When extracting string values,
      translate them in English if the original language of the document is not English.\n\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" (found under \"Concept extracted item type\"). Ensure your extracted
      items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string,
      int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\n    --
      Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n\n- Handling
      missing or multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your
      output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n    -- For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if none
      of the predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \"extracted_items\"
      array empty.\n    -- For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g.,
      {\"labels\": [\"label1\", \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items
      if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\n    -- For concepts that do not have an \"Available labels:\"
      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n- No additional text:\n    --
      Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON array.\n    --
      Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other formatting characters.\n\n======\nANSWER
      FORMAT (MANDATORY):\n[\n    {\n        \"concept_id\": str,\n        \"extracted_items:
      [\n            ...\n        ],\n    },\n    ...\n]\n======\n\n______\nCONCEPTS:\n````\n-

      obligation to Disclosing Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving
      Party without reference to or use of any Confidential Information. The name
      of the dog of the Receiving Party is Bob.\nThe designation of information as
      Confidential Information shall not be determinative of whether such information
      constitutes a trade secret under applicable law. All Confidential Information
      shall remain the exclusive property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party
      shall have no rights, by license or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information
      except as expressly provided herein.\n\n3. Obligations of Receiving Party:\n\nThe
      party receiving Confidential Information (\"Receiving Party\") shall:\n\na.
      Maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and not disclose
      it to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\n\nb.
      Use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging
      in the potential business collaboration.\n\nc. Take all necessary precautions

      to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party''s discretion.\n\n5.
      Liability:\n\na. Total Liability Cap:\n The total liability of either party
      for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement, whether
      in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i) $100,000
      or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing Party
      under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve

      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\n\n7. No License:\n\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving

      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\n\nb. Any amendments or
      modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both parties.\n\nc.
      If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, the remainder
      shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision shall
      be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\n\nd. The
      Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\n\nIN WITNESS
      WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement as of

    body: '{"model": "llama3.1:8b", "prompt": "### System:\nYou will be assigned tasks
      involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various
      types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide
      accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional
      experience and qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments represent
      portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their limited context.
      When working with fragments, focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain
      textual or visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can
      be directly read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams,
      blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require
      visual interpretation.\n\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document
      that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject
      or theme described in the task. For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms,
      parties involved, or termination clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item
      breakdowns, or tax details.\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou
      will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance and context
      within the document.\n\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant
      to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader document
      context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from simple
      entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance
      evaluations, or pattern identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining
      whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n-
      Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments
      based on document content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization
      using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision
      and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly stated or can be directly
      inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond
      what the document content clearly supports.\n\n- Visual content analysis: When
      processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine all visual elements carefully,
      including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos, layout structures, etc.\n  --
      Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships, and structural information
      that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  -- Consider the visual context
      and layout as it may provide important semantic information.\n  -- Analyze information
      in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams with attention to their visual structure
      and relationships.\n\n- Contextual understanding: Consider the full context
      when performing extractions. A single paragraph or sentence may have different
      meanings depending on surrounding content, document type, and domain-specific
      terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  --
      The nature and type of the document\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you
      need to focus on\n  -- The expected output format and structure requirements\n  --
      Any constraints or special handling instructions\n\n- Quality control: After
      extraction, verify that:\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to
      the specified aspects/concepts\n  -- The output format matches the required
      schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information has been included\n  -- All mandatory
      fields are present and correctly populated\n\n- Conservative approach: When
      in doubt about whether information qualifies for extraction:\n  -- If the relevance
      is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  -- If multiple interpretations are
      possible, choose the most conservative one\n  -- If information is ambiguous,
      do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly
      to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  -- Add extra fields beyond
      what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field names\n  -- Include explanatory
      text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code blocks or formatting markers
      unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n- Structured outputs:
      Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the task requirements.\n-
      Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions, include justifications
      or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when required): When required
      by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or noteworthy findings that
      could add value to the task.\n- References (when required): When required by
      the instructions, output references based on which you extracted data, provided
      insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering to this framework,
      you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across diverse document
      analysis tasks.\n\n### User:\nBelow you will find a list of consecutively ordered
      paragraphs from a document and a list of aspects. Your task is to:\n\n1. Read
      and understand the aspects\n- Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for
      example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\n- Aspects
      describe themes, topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\n\n2.
      Examine each paragraph\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for
      example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n- You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\n- A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none
      of the aspects.\n- If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the
      aspect''s name and description), include that paragraph''s ID under the aspect''s
      list of paragraph IDs.\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not
      include it under that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final answer in the
      specified JSON format\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object
      corresponding to a single aspect.\n- For each aspect (in the order they are
      provided), include:\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g.,
      \"A0\".\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array of the paragraph IDs that address or
      relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\", \"P2\"].\n    -- If an aspect has no related
      paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not
      add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the
      JSON array.\n\nUse the following answer format as a guide for your final answer
      (remember: no surrounding text or ```json delimiters should be included).\n\n======\nANSWER

        to the \"Liability\" section (Paragraphs 36-40) and identify the relevant

        introduces the concept of liability in the agreement.\n* It does not contain
        specific details about the liability cap or penalties for breach.\n\n**Paragraph
        37: Total Liability Cap**\n\n* The total liability of either party for any
        claims arising out of or related to this Agreement shall not exceed the greater
        of (i) $100,000 or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the

        This limitation of liability is cumulative and not per incident.\n\n**Paragraph
        38: Penalties for Breach**\n\n* In the event of a breach of this Agreement

        remedy.\n\n**Paragraph 39: Liquidated Damages**\n\n* In addition to injunctive
        relief, the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the
        amount of $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
        Information.\n* The parties agree that this represents a reasonable estimate
        of the damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\n\n**Paragraph 40:
        No License**\n\n* Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting
        any rights to the Receiving Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the

        forth in this Agreement.\n\nNow, I will create a list of relevant information
        for each paragraph related to liability:\n\n1. **Paragraph 36: Liability**\n\t*
        Introduced concept of liability\n2. **Paragraph 37: Total Liability Cap**\n\t*
        Total liability cap is the greater of $100,000 or the total amount paid by
        Receiving Party under separate business agreement within 12 months preceding
        claim\n\t* Limitation of liability is cumulative and not per incident\n3.
        **Paragraph 38: Penalties for Breach**\n\t* Injunctive relief available in
        addition to other remedies\n\t* Breach may cause irreparable harm, making
        monetary damages inadequate\n4. **Paragraph 39: Liquidated Damages**\n\t*
        Receiving Party liable for $25,000 liquidated damages per instance of unauthorized
        disclosure or use\n\t* Represents reasonable estimate of damages and not a
        penalty\n5. **Paragraph 40: No License**\n\t* No rights granted to Receiving
        Party by license or otherwise, except as expressly stated in Agreement\n\nNext,
        I will create the output in the requested format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Liability\":

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects. Your task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n-
      Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\",
      etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes,
      topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine
      each paragraph\\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example,
      \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n- You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\\n- A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none
      of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the
      aspect's name and description), include that paragraph's ID under the aspect's
      list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not
      include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final answer in the
      specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each
      object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For each aspect (in the order they
      are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier,
      e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array of the paragraph IDs that
      address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If
      an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids
      array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other
      formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse the following answer format as a

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below

      answer format (do not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory

      \\\"concept_id\\\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\",
      \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n    -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an

      the array empty ([]).\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly
      mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information
      present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted
      items for the concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\".

      all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If a rating scale
      is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating scale,\\\" the extracted item value
      must be within that scale.\\n    -- If available labels are provided for a concept
      under \\\"Available labels,\\\" the extracted item value must be a list containing
      only labels from the predefined set. If none of the predefined labels apply,
      do not extract any items for that concept.\\n    -- If there are example items

      them in English if the original language of the document is not English.\\n\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure your extracted
      items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string,
      int for integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\\n
      \   -- Do not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n\\n-
      Handling missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at
      all, your output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty

      leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array empty.\\n    -- For concepts that have
      an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if multiple labels apply to the same instance
      or context, include them all in a single extracted item with multiple labels
      in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g., {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}).
      Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct instances
      or contexts that warrant separate classification.\\n    -- For concepts that
      do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section: if multiple items are found
      for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations,

      Purpose:\\n\\nThe purpose of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information
      that may be disclosed between the parties during discussions and engagements
      regarding potential business collaborations and partnerships.\\n\\n2. Definition
      of Confidential Information:\\n\\nFor purposes of this Agreement, \\\"Confidential
      Information\\\" means any and all non-public information, conveyed in all forms,
      whether in oral, written, electronic, or other form or media, whether or not
      marked, designated, or otherwise identified as \\\"confidential,\\\" that has
      been or may be disclosed to, accessed by, or observed by Receiving Party, which
      (i) has actual or potential economic value by virtue of not being generally
      known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons
      who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, or (ii) is subject
      to reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain its secrecy and confidentiality.\\n\\nConfidential
      Information includes, but is not limited to, the following categories: (1) business
      information (business plans, strategies, and models), (2) technical information
      (technical specifications and documentation, research and development activities),
      (3) customer and market information (customer lists and contact information,
      sales histories and patterns), (4) personnel and internal information (employee
      lists and contact information, employment agreements and personnel files), (5)
      intellectual property (trade secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications,
      copyrights and copyright applications, trademarks and trademark applications),
      (6) strategic information (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses
      and strategies). Software code shall also be included into the confidential
      information.\\n\\nConfidential Information shall not include information that:
      (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of
      disclosure by Receiving Party or its Representatives; (b) was available to Receiving
      Party on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party;
      (c) becomes available to Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a
      person other than Disclosing Party who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality
      obligation to Disclosing Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving
      Party without reference to or use of any Confidential Information. The name
      of the dog of the Receiving Party is Bob.\\nThe designation of information as
      Confidential Information shall not be determinative of whether such information
      constitutes a trade secret under applicable law. All Confidential Information
      shall remain the exclusive property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party
      shall have no rights, by license or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information
      except as expressly provided herein.\\n\\n3. Obligations of Receiving Party:\\n\\nThe
      party receiving Confidential Information (\\\"Receiving Party\\\") shall:\\n\\na.
      Maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and not disclose
      it to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\\n\\nb.
      Use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging
      in the potential business collaboration.\\n\\nc. Take all necessary precautions

      Exclusions from Confidential Information:\\n\\nConfidential Information does
      not include information that:\\n\\na. Is or becomes publicly known through no
      wrongful act of the Receiving Party.\\n\\nb. Is already known to the Receiving
      Party at the time of disclosure.\\n\\nc. Is lawfully received from a third party
      without breach of this Agreement.\\n\\nd. Is independently developed by the
      Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential
      Information.\\n\\n6. Return of Materials:\\n\\nUpon termination of this Agreement

      Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy them, at the Disclosing Party's
      discretion.\\n\\n5. Liability:\\n\\na. Total Liability Cap:\\n The total liability
      of either party for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement,
      whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i)
      $100,000 or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing
      Party under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of
      liability is cumulative and not per incident.\\n\\nb. Penalties for Breach:\\n
      In the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\\n\\n7. No License:\\n\\nNothing
      in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving
      Party, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential

      or written agreements concerning such subject matter.\\n\\nb. Any amendments
      or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both
      parties.\\n\\nc. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable,
      the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision
      shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement
      in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties.\\n\\nd.
      The Disclosing Party shall be a good person to execute this contract.\\n\\nIN

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects. Your task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n-
      Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\",
      etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes,
      topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine
      each paragraph\\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example,
      \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n- You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3.
      Map paragraphs to aspects\\n- A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none
      of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the
      aspect's name and description), include that paragraph's ID under the aspect's
      list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not
      include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final answer in the
      specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each
      object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For each aspect (in the order they

      e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array of the paragraph IDs that
      address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If
      an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids
      array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other
      formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse the following answer format as a

      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file containing
      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints,
      photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\n-
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger
      document and should be analyzed within their limited context. When working with
      fragments, focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain textual or
      visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can be directly
      read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints,
      tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --
      The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\n  -- The expected output
      format and structure requirements\n  -- Any constraints or special handling
      instructions\n\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n  -- All
      extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n  --
      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --
      Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field
      names\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code
      blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n-
      Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the
      task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions,
      include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when
      required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or
      noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References (when required):
      When required by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted
      data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering
      to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across
      diverse document analysis tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"Below you will
      find document text and a list of concepts.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Read through
      the document text provided.\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts
      list is addressed within the document text.\n3. For each concept that appears,
      extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure
      are specified for each concept.\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\n\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      text, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" list.\n\nFollow these additional rules:\n\n- Output format:\nProvide
      your answer in only the following answer format (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\n\n- Consistency:\n    -- Each
      JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\" and \"extracted_items\".\n    --
      The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value of \"extracted_items\" must be an array.
      If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the
      array empty ([]).\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly
      mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information
      present).\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items
      for the concept is specified under \"Amount of extracted items\". Each extracted
      item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n-
      Item structure:\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for a concept under
      \"Expected structure,\" you must follow that structure for all extracted items
      corresponding to that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept
      under \"Rating scale,\" the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    --
      If available labels are provided for a concept under \"Available labels,\" the
      extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined
      set. If none of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that
      concept.\n    -- If there are example items (\"Extracted concept examples\"),
      try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n    --
      When extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\n\n- Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each
      concept specifies an \"extracted item type\" (found under \"Concept extracted
      item type\"). Ensure your extracted items strictly match that type. Python types
      are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point
      number, dict for object, etc.).\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or
      modify the specified structure.\n\n- Handling missing or multiple items:\n    --
      If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still contain an entry
      for that concept with an empty \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For concepts
      that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if none of the predefined labels
      apply to the content, leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty.\n    -- For
      concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if multiple labels apply
      to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted item
      with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below

      array. If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave
      the array empty ([]).\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly
      mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information
      present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted
      items for the concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\".
      Each extracted item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n\\n- Item structure:\\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for
      a concept under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" you must follow that structure for
      all extracted items corresponding to that concept.\\n    -- If a rating scale

      only labels from the predefined set. If none of the predefined labels apply,
      do not extract any items for that concept.\\n    -- If there are example items
      (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"), try to follow the same style and formatting
      for your extracted items.\\n    -- When extracting string values, translate
      them in English if the original language of the document is not English.\\n\\n-
      Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies an \\\"extracted item
      type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\"). Ensure your extracted
      items strictly match that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string,
