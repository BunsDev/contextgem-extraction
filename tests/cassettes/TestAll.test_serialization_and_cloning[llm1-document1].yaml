    body: '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You will be assigned tasks involving
      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file containing
      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints,
      photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\n-
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger
      document and should be analyzed within their limited context. When working with
      fragments, focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain textual or
      visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can be directly
      read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints,
      tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --
      The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\n  -- The expected output
      format and structure requirements\n  -- Any constraints or special handling
      instructions\n\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n  -- All
      extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n  --
      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --
      Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field
      names\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code
      blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n-
      Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the
      task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions,
      include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when
      required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or
      noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References (when required):
      When required by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted
      data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering
      to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across
      diverse document analysis tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"Below you will
      find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and a list of
      aspects. Your task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n- Each aspect
      is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.), includes
      a name, and has a description.\n- Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria
      that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n- Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.),
      followed by the full text of the paragraph.\n- When available, additional context
      information for paragraphs (such as formatting, list context, or table position)
      will be provided under \"Additional information about the paragraph:\" sections,
      which provides important context for understanding their structural role and
      position within the document. Use this information to:\n    -- Understand document
      hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section boundaries)\n    -- Recognize relationships
      between content (e.g., list items are related, table cells contain associated
      data)\n    -- Assess content significance (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)\n-
      Note that paragraphs are provided in markdown format, which may include formatting
      elements such as headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\n- Note
      that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original document;
      therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular
      paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n- You may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs
      to aspects\n- A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n-
      If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect''s name and
      description), include that paragraph''s ID under the aspect''s list of paragraph
      IDs.\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under
      that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\n-
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n- For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n    --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n    -- paragraph_ids:
      An array of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\",
      \"P2\"].\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with
      an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block
      markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\n\nUse the following
      answer format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding text
      or ```json delimiters should be included).\n\n======\nANSWER FORMAT (MANDATORY):\n[\n    {\n        \"aspect_id\":

      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects. Your task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n-
      Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\",
      etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes,
      topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine
      each paragraph\\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example,
      \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\\n-
      When available, additional context information for paragraphs (such as formatting,
      list context, or table position) will be provided under \\\"Additional information
      about the paragraph:\\\" sections, which provides important context for understanding
      their structural role and position within the document. Use this information
      to:\\n    -- Understand document hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section
      boundaries)\\n    -- Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list items
      are related, table cells contain associated data)\\n    -- Assess content significance
      (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)\\n- Note that paragraphs are provided
      in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings,
      links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n- Note that paragraphs are listed
      in the same order they appear in the original document; therefore, context from
      surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular paragraph is relevant
      to an aspect.\\n- You may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      that paragraph's ID under the aspect's list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph
      does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4.
      Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be
      a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For
      each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The
      aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array
      of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary,
      code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse
      the following answer format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding

      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file containing
      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints,
      photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\n-
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger
      document and should be analyzed within their limited context. When working with
      fragments, focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain textual or
      visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can be directly
      read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints,
      tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --
      The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\n  -- The expected output
      format and structure requirements\n  -- Any constraints or special handling
      instructions\n\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n  -- All
      extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n  --
      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --
      Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field
      names\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code
      blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n-
      Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the
      task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions,
      include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when

      When required by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted
      data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering
      to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across
      diverse document analysis tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"Below you will
      find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and a list of
      aspects. Your task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n- Each aspect
      is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.), includes
      a name, and has a description.\n- Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria
      that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph\n- Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.),
      followed by the full text of the paragraph.\n- When available, additional context
      information for paragraphs (such as formatting, list context, or table position)
      will be provided under \"Additional information about the paragraph:\" sections,
      which provides important context for understanding their structural role and
      position within the document. Use this information to:\n    -- Understand document
      hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section boundaries)\n    -- Recognize relationships
      between content (e.g., list items are related, table cells contain associated
      data)\n    -- Assess content significance (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)\n-
      Note that paragraphs are provided in markdown format, which may include formatting
      elements such as headings, links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\n- Note
      that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original document;
      therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular
      paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\n- You may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs
      to aspects\n- A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\n-
      If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect''s name and
      description), include that paragraph''s ID under the aspect''s list of paragraph
      IDs.\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under
      that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\n-
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n- For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n    --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n    -- paragraph_ids:
      An array of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\"P0\",
      \"P2\"].\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with
      an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block
      markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\n\nUse the following
      answer format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding text
      or ```json delimiters should be included).\n\n======\nANSWER FORMAT (MANDATORY):\n[\n    {\n        \"aspect_id\":

    body: '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You will be assigned tasks involving
      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file containing
      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints,
      photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\n-
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger
      document and should be analyzed within their limited context. When working with
      fragments, focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain textual or
      visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can be directly
      read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints,
      tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --
      The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\n  -- The expected output
      format and structure requirements\n  -- Any constraints or special handling
      instructions\n\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n  -- All
      extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n  --
      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --
      Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field
      names\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code
      blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n-
      Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the
      task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions,
      include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when
      required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or
      noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References (when required):
      When required by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted
      data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering
      to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across
      diverse document analysis tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"Below you will

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly

      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n

      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and

      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects. Your task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n-
      Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\",
      etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes,
      topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine
      each paragraph and its sentences\\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph
      ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.).\\n- Each paragraph includes
      sentences, each identified by a sentence ID (for example, \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the sentence.\\n- When available, additional
      context information for paragraphs and sentences (such as formatting, list context,
      or table position) will be provided under \\\"Additional information about the
      paragraph:\\\" and \\\"Additional information about the sentence:\\\" sections,
      which provides important context for understanding their structural role and
      position within the document. Use this information to:\\n    -- Understand document
      hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section boundaries)\\n    -- Recognize relationships
      between content (e.g., list items are related, table cells contain associated
      data)\\n    -- Assess content significance (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)\\n-
      Note that paragraphs are listed in the same order they appear in the original
      document; therefore, context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether
      a particular paragraph is relevant to an aspect.\\n- You may be working with
      document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3.
      Map paragraphs and their sentences to aspects\\n- A paragraph can address one,
      multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- A sentence within the paragraph can address
      one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph clearly relates to
      an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include the paragraph's
      ID and the IDs of all the sentences within the paragraph that address or relate
      to the aspect.\\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not include
      it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final answer in the specified
      JSON format\\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding
      to a single aspect.\\n- For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\\n
      \   -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    --
      paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses or relates
      to the aspect. Each object should include:\\n        --- paragraph_id: The provided
      paragraph ID, e.g., \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\".\\n        --- sentences: An array
      of objects for each relevant sentence within the paragraph. Each object should
      include:\\n            --- sentence_id: The provided ID of the sentence, e.g.,
      \\\"P0-S0\\\", \\\"P0-S2\\\".\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs,
      still include it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra
      commentary, code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse
      the following answer format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding
      text or ```json delimiters should be included).\\n\\n======\\nANSWER FORMAT

      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file containing
      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints,
      photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\n-
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger
      document and should be analyzed within their limited context. When working with
      fragments, focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain textual or
      visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can be directly
      read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints,
      tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --
      The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\n  -- The expected output
      format and structure requirements\n  -- Any constraints or special handling
      instructions\n\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n  -- All
      extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n  --
      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --
      Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field
      names\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code
      blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n-
      Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the
      task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions,
      include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when
      required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or
      noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References (when required):
      When required by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted
      data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering
      to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across
      diverse document analysis tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"Below you will
      find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and a list of
      aspects. Your task is to:\n\n1. Read and understand the aspects\n- Each aspect
      is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \"A0\", \"A1\", etc.), includes
      a name, and has a description.\n- Aspects describe themes, topics, or criteria
      that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\n\n2. Examine each paragraph and
      its sentences\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example,
      \"P0\", \"P1\", etc.).\n- Each paragraph includes sentences, each identified
      by a sentence ID (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S1\", etc.), followed by the
      full text of the sentence.\n- When available, additional context information
      for paragraphs and sentences (such as formatting, list context, or table position)
      will be provided under \"Additional information about the paragraph:\" and \"Additional
      information about the sentence:\" sections, which provides important context
      for understanding their structural role and position within the document. Use
      this information to:\n    -- Understand document hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate
      section boundaries)\n    -- Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list
      items are related, table cells contain associated data)\n    -- Assess content
      significance (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)\n- Note that paragraphs
      are listed in the same order they appear in the original document; therefore,
      context from surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular paragraph
      is relevant to an aspect.\n- You may be working with document fragments rather
      than complete documents. Focus on extracting information from the available
      content without making assumptions about missing parts.\n\n3. Map paragraphs
      and their sentences to aspects\n- A paragraph can address one, multiple, or
      none of the aspects.\n- A sentence within the paragraph can address one, multiple,
      or none of the aspects.\n- If a paragraph clearly relates to an aspect (based
      on the aspect''s name and description), include the paragraph''s ID and the
      IDs of all the sentences within the paragraph that address or relate to the
      aspect.\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under
      that aspect''s list.\n\n4. Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\n-
      Your output must be a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a
      single aspect.\n- For each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\n    --
      aspect_id: The aspect''s unique identifier, e.g., \"A0\".\n    -- paragraphs:
      An array of objects for each paragraph that addresses or relates to the aspect.
      Each object should include:\n        --- paragraph_id: The provided paragraph
      ID, e.g., \"P0\", \"P2\".\n        --- sentences: An array of objects for each
      relevant sentence within the paragraph. Each object should include:\n            ---
      sentence_id: The provided ID of the sentence, e.g., \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\".\n    --
      If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include it with an empty paragraph_ids
      array ([]).\n- Do not add extra commentary, code block markers, or any other
      formatting beyond the JSON array.\n\nUse the following answer format as a guide
      for your final answer (remember: no surrounding text or ```json delimiters should
      be included).\n\n======\nANSWER FORMAT (MANDATORY):\n[\n    {\n        \"aspect_id\":

      making assumptions about missing parts.\n2. Identify whether each concept in
      the concepts list is addressed within the document paragraphs.\n3. For each
      concept that appears, extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The
      item format and structure are specified for each concept.\n4. Produce a JSON
      array containing your extracted data, in the provided format.\n\nIf a concept
      is not addressed in the document paragraphs, you must still include an entry
      in the final JSON output but with an empty \"extracted_items\" list.\n\nFollow
      these additional rules:\n\n- Output format:\nProvide your answer in only the
      following answer format (do not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory
      text).\n\n- Consistency:\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two
      keys: \"concept_id\" and \"extracted_items\".\n    -- The value of \"concept_id\"
      must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    --
      The value of \"extracted_items\" must be an array of objects with mandatory
      fields \"value\", \"justification\", and \"reference_paragraphs\". If the concept
      is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\n        ---
      Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from
      the content (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        ---
      Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is
      specified under \"Amount of extracted items\". Each extracted item''s object,
      even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n        ---
      The value of \"reference_paragraphs\" must be an array of objects with mandatory
      fields \"reference_paragraph_id\", which holds the provided ID of the reference
      paragraph, and \"reference_sentence_ids\", which holds the provided IDs of the
      reference sentences within the paragraph. Note that not every sentence in the
      paragraph necessarily serves as a relevant reference.\n\n- Item object structure:\n    --
      value: Mandatory field holding the extracted item.\n        --- If a specific
      structure is provided for a concept under \"Expected structure,\" the extracted
      item value must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding
      to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided for a concept under
      \"Rating scale,\" the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n        ---
      If available labels are provided for a concept under \"Available labels,\" the
      extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined
      set. If none of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that
      concept.\n        --- If there are example items (\"Extracted concept examples\"),
      the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\n        ---
      When extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\n    -- justification: Mandatory field holding
      a justification of why the item was extracted for the concept. Ensure the justification
      is specific and directly ties the extracted item to the concept''s defining
      features. Never reference the concept''s ID or any of the structural IDs provided
      in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\")
      in the justification.\n        --- Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight
      only the essential details.\n        --- Justification should be no longer than
      2 sentences.\n        --- Justification should be in English.\n    -- reference_paragraphs:
      An array of objects for each paragraph based on which the item was extracted
      for the concept. Each object should include:\n        --- reference_paragraph_id:
      Mandatory field holding the provided ID of the reference paragraph. Each paragraph
      ID must match exactly the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \"P0\",
      \"P1\", etc.).\n        --- reference_sentence_ids: Mandatory field holding
      an array of the provided IDs of the sentences within the paragraph, based on
      which the item was extracted for the concept. Each sentence ID must match exactly
      the provided ID for the sentence (for example, \"P0-S0\", \"P0-S2\", etc.).\n\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" (found under \"Concept extracted item type\"). Ensure that the value
      of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type. Python
      types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point
      number, dict for object, etc.).\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or
      modify the specified structure.\n\n- Handling missing or multiple items:\n    --
      If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still contain an entry
      for that concept with an empty \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For concepts
      that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if none of the predefined labels
      apply to the content, leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty.\n    -- For
      concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if multiple labels apply
      to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted item
      with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have an \"Available labels:\" section: if multiple items are found
      for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n\n- No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations,
      or text outside of the JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in

    body: '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You will be assigned tasks involving
      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file containing
      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints,
      photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\n-
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger
      document and should be analyzed within their limited context. When working with
      fragments, focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain textual or
      visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can be directly
      read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints,
      tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --
      The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\n  -- The expected output
      format and structure requirements\n  -- Any constraints or special handling
      instructions\n\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n  -- All
      extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n  --
      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --
      Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field
      names\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code
      blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n-
      Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the
      task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions,
      include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when
      required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or
      noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References (when required):
      When required by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted
      data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering
      to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across
      diverse document analysis tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"Below you will

      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file containing
      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints,
      photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\n-
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger
      document and should be analyzed within their limited context. When working with
      fragments, focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain textual or
      visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can be directly
      read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints,
      tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --
      The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\n  -- The expected output
      format and structure requirements\n  -- Any constraints or special handling
      instructions\n\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n  -- All
      extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n  --
      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --
      Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field
      names\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code
      blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n-
      Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the
      task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions,
      include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when
      required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or
      noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References (when required):
      When required by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted
      data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering
      to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across
      diverse document analysis tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"Below you will
      find document text and a list of concepts.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Read through
      the document text provided.\n    - Note that the document text is provided in
      markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings, links,
      lists, and other markdown syntax.\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts
      list is addressed within the document text.\n3. For each concept that appears,
      extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure
      are specified for each concept.\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\n\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      text, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" list.\n\nFollow these additional rules:\n\n- Output format:\nProvide
      your answer in only the following answer format (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\n\n- Consistency:\n    -- Each
      JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\" and \"extracted_items\".\n    --
      The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value of \"extracted_items\" must be an array
      of objects with mandatory fields \"value\" and \"justification\". If the concept
      is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\n        ---
      Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from
      the content (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        ---
      Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is
      specified under \"Amount of extracted items\". Each extracted item''s object,
      even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item.\n        --- If a specific structure is provided for a concept under \"Expected
      structure,\" the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept under \"Rating scale,\" the extracted item value must be within
      that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided for a concept under
      \"Available labels,\" the extracted item value must be a list containing only
      labels from the predefined set. If none of the predefined labels apply, do not
      extract any items for that concept.\n        --- If there are example items
      (\"Extracted concept examples\"), the extracted item value should follow the
      same style and formatting.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate
      them in English if the original language of the document is not English.\n    --
      justification: Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted
      for the concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the
      extracted item to the concept''s defining features. Never reference the concept''s
      ID or any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs
      like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\") in the justification.\n        ---
      Justification should be balanced, i.e. cover the key insights with enough detail
      to be informative, while remaining concise.\n        --- Justification should
      be no longer than 5 sentences.\n        --- Justification should be in English.\n\n-
      Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies an \"extracted item
      type\" (found under \"Concept extracted item type\"). Ensure that the value
      of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches that type. Python
      types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point
      number, dict for object, etc.).\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or
      modify the specified structure.\n\n- Handling missing or multiple items:\n    --
      If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still contain an entry
      for that concept with an empty \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For concepts
      that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if none of the predefined labels
      apply to the content, leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty.\n    -- For
      concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if multiple labels apply
      to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted item
      with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have an \"Available labels:\" section: if multiple items are found
      for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n\n- No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations,
      or text outside of the JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in
      backticks or any other formatting characters.\n\n======\nANSWER FORMAT (MANDATORY):\n[\n    {\n        \"concept_id\":

      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --
      Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field
      names\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code
      blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n-
      Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the
      task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions,
      include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when
      required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or
      noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References (when required):
      When required by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted
      data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering

      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file containing
      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints,
      photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\n-
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger
      document and should be analyzed within their limited context. When working with
      fragments, focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain textual or
      visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can be directly
      read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints,
      tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine

      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --

      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --

      If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still contain an entry
      for that concept with an empty \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For concepts
      that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if none of the predefined labels
      apply to the content, leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty.\n    -- For
      concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if multiple labels apply
      to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted item
      with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have an \"Available labels:\" section: if multiple items are found
      for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n\n- No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations,
      or text outside of the JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in

      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file containing
      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints,
      photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\n-
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger
      document and should be analyzed within their limited context. When working with
      fragments, focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain textual or
      visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can be directly
      read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints,
      tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --
      The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\n  -- The expected output
      format and structure requirements\n  -- Any constraints or special handling
      instructions\n\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n  -- All
      extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n  --
      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --
      Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field
      names\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code
      blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n-
      Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the
      task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions,
      include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when
      required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or
      noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References (when required):
      When required by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted
      data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering
      to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across
      diverse document analysis tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"Below you will
      find document text and a list of concepts.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Read through
      the document text provided.\n    - Note that the document text is provided in
      markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings, links,
      lists, and other markdown syntax.\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts
      list is addressed within the document text.\n3. For each concept that appears,
      extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure
      are specified for each concept.\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\n\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      text, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" list.\n\nFollow these additional rules:\n\n- Output format:\nProvide
      your answer in only the following answer format (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\n\n- Consistency:\n    -- Each
      JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\" and \"extracted_items\".\n    --
      The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value of \"extracted_items\" must be an array.
      If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the
      array empty ([]).\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly
      mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information
      present).\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items
      for the concept is specified under \"Amount of extracted items\". Each extracted
      item, even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n-
      Item structure:\n    -- If a specific structure is provided for a concept under
      \"Expected structure,\" you must follow that structure for all extracted items
      corresponding to that concept.\n    -- If a rating scale is provided for a concept
      under \"Rating scale,\" the extracted item value must be within that scale.\n    --
      If available labels are provided for a concept under \"Available labels,\" the
      extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined
      set. If none of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that
      concept.\n    -- If there are example items (\"Extracted concept examples\"),
      try to follow the same style and formatting for your extracted items.\n    --
      When extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\n\n- Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each
      concept specifies an \"extracted item type\" (found under \"Concept extracted
      item type\"). Ensure your extracted items strictly match that type. Python types
      are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer, float for floating-point
      number, dict for object, etc.).\n    -- Do not introduce any extra fields or
      modify the specified structure.\n\n- Handling missing or multiple items:\n    --
      If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should still contain an entry
      for that concept with an empty \"extracted_items\" array.\n    -- For concepts
      that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if none of the predefined labels
      apply to the content, leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty.\n    -- For
      concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if multiple labels apply
      to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted item
      with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have an \"Available labels:\" section: if multiple items are found
      for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n\n- No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations,

      Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this Agreement is to protect the confidential information
      that may be disclosed between the parties during discussions and engagements
      regarding potential business collaborations and partnerships.\n\n## Definition
      of Confidential Information\n\nFor purposes of this Agreement, \"Confidential
      Information\" means any and all non-public information, conveyed in all forms,
      whether in oral, written, electronic, or other form or media, whether or not
      marked, designated, or otherwise identified as \"confidential,\" that has been
      or may be disclosed to, accessed by, or observed by Receiving Party, which (i)
      has actual or potential economic value by virtue of not being generally known
      to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who
      can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, or (ii) is subject to
      reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain its secrecy and confidentiality.\n\nConfidential
      Information includes, but is not limited to, the following categories: (1) business
      information (business plans, strategies, and models), (2) technical information
      (technical specifications and documentation, research and development activities),
      (3) customer and market information (customer lists and contact information,
      sales histories and patterns), (4) personnel and internal information (employee
      lists and contact information, employment agreements and personnel files), (5)
      intellectual property (trade secrets and know-how, patents and patent applications,
      copyrights and copyright applications, trademarks and trademark applications),
      (6) strategic information (merger and acquisition plans, competitive analyses
      and strategies). Software code shall also be included into the confidential
      information.\n\nConfidential Information shall not include information that:
      (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of
      disclosure by Receiving Party or its Representatives; (b) was available to Receiving
      Party on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by Disclosing Party;
      (c) becomes available to Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a
      person other than Disclosing Party who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality
      obligation to Disclosing Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving
      Party without reference to or use of any Confidential Information. The name
      of the dog of the Receiving Party is Bob.\n\nThe designation of information
      as Confidential Information shall not be determinative of whether such information
      constitutes a trade secret under applicable law. All Confidential Information
      shall remain the exclusive property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party
      shall have no rights, by license or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information
      except as expressly provided herein.\n\n## Obligations of Receiving Party\n\nThe
      party receiving Confidential Information (\"Receiving Party\") shall:\n\n1.
      Maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and not disclose
      it to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\n\n2.
      Use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging
      in the potential business collaboration.\n\n3. Take all necessary precautions
      to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information, which shall
      be no less than the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information.\n\n##

      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References

      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file containing
      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints,
      photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\n-
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger
      document and should be analyzed within their limited context. When working with
      fragments, focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain textual or
      visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can be directly
      read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints,
      tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --
      The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\n  -- The expected output
      format and structure requirements\n  -- Any constraints or special handling
      instructions\n\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n  -- All
      extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n  --
      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --
      Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field
      names\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code
      blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n-
      Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the
      task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions,
      include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when
      required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or
      noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References (when required):
      When required by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted
      data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering
      to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across
      diverse document analysis tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"Below you will

    body: '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You will be assigned tasks involving
      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file containing
      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints,
      photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\n-
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger
      document and should be analyzed within their limited context. When working with
      fragments, focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain textual or
      visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can be directly
      read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints,
      tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --
      The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\n  -- The expected output
      format and structure requirements\n  -- Any constraints or special handling
      instructions\n\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n  -- All
      extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n  --
      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --
      Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field
      names\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code
      blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n-
      Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the
      task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions,
      include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when
      required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or
      noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References (when required):
      When required by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted
      data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering
      to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across
      diverse document analysis tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"Below you will
      find document text and a list of concepts.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Read through
      the document text provided.\n    - Note that the document text is provided in
      markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings, links,
      lists, and other markdown syntax.\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts
      list is addressed within the document text.\n3. For each concept that appears,
      extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure
      are specified for each concept.\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\n\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      text, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" list.\n\nFollow these additional rules:\n\n- Output format:\nProvide
      your answer in only the following answer format (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\n\n- Consistency:\n    -- Each
      JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\" and \"extracted_items\".\n    --
      The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value of \"extracted_items\" must be an array
      of objects with mandatory fields \"value\" and \"justification\". If the concept
      is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\n        ---
      Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from
      the content (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        ---
      Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is
      specified under \"Amount of extracted items\". Each extracted item''s object,
      even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item.\n        --- If a specific structure is provided for a concept under \"Expected
      structure,\" the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept under \"Rating scale,\" the extracted item value must be within
      that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided for a concept under
      \"Available labels,\" the extracted item value must be a list containing only
      labels from the predefined set. If none of the predefined labels apply, do not
      extract any items for that concept.\n        --- If there are example items
      (\"Extracted concept examples\"), the extracted item value should follow the
      same style and formatting.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate
      them in English if the original language of the document is not English.\n    --
      justification: Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted
      for the concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the
      extracted item to the concept''s defining features. Never reference the concept''s
      ID or any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs
      like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\") in the justification.\n        ---
      Justification should be comprehensive, i.e. deliver an in-depth explanation
      that thoroughly details the rationale and supporting evidence.\n        ---
      Justification should be no longer than 10 sentences.\n        --- Justification
      should be in English.\n\n- Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies
      an \"extracted item type\" (found under \"Concept extracted item type\"). Ensure
      that the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches
      that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer,
      float for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\n    -- Do not introduce
      any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n\n- Handling missing or
      multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should
      still contain an entry for that concept with an empty \"extracted_items\" array.\n    --
      For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if none of the predefined
      labels apply to the content, leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty.\n    --
      For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if multiple labels
      apply to the same instance or context, include them all in a single extracted
      item with multiple labels in the \"labels\" array (e.g., {\"labels\": [\"label1\",
      \"label2\"]}). Only create multiple extracted items if there are genuinely distinct
      instances or contexts that warrant separate classification.\n    -- For concepts
      that do not have an \"Available labels:\" section: if multiple items are found
      for a concept, include each as a separate entry within the \"extracted_items\"
      array.\n\n- No additional text:\n    -- Do not include any headers, explanations,
      or text outside of the JSON array.\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in
      backticks or any other formatting characters.\n\n======\nANSWER FORMAT (MANDATORY):\n[\n    {\n        \"concept_id\":

      obligation to Disclosing Party; or (d) was independently developed by Receiving
      Party without reference to or use of any Confidential Information. The name
      of the dog of the Receiving Party is Bob.\n\nThe designation of information
      as Confidential Information shall not be determinative of whether such information
      constitutes a trade secret under applicable law. All Confidential Information
      shall remain the exclusive property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party
      shall have no rights, by license or otherwise, to use the Confidential Information
      except as expressly provided herein.\n\n## Obligations of Receiving Party\n\nThe
      party receiving Confidential Information (\"Receiving Party\") shall:\n\n1.
      Maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and not disclose

      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects. Your task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n-
      Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\",
      etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes,
      topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine
      each paragraph\\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example,
      \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\\n-
      When available, additional context information for paragraphs (such as formatting,
      list context, or table position) will be provided under \\\"Additional information
      about the paragraph:\\\" sections, which provides important context for understanding
      their structural role and position within the document. Use this information
      to:\\n    -- Understand document hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section
      boundaries)\\n    -- Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list items
      are related, table cells contain associated data)\\n    -- Assess content significance
      (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)\\n- Note that paragraphs are provided
      in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings,
      links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n- Note that paragraphs are listed
      in the same order they appear in the original document; therefore, context from
      surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular paragraph is relevant
      to an aspect.\\n- You may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      that paragraph's ID under the aspect's list of paragraph IDs.\\n- If a paragraph
      does not relate to an aspect, do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4.
      Produce the final answer in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be
      a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For
      each aspect (in the order they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The
      aspect's unique identifier, e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraph_ids: An array
      of the paragraph IDs that address or relate to the aspect, e.g., [\\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P2\\\"].\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraph_ids array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary,
      code block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse
      the following answer format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding
      text or ```json delimiters should be included).\\n\\n======\\nANSWER FORMAT

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of consecutively ordered paragraphs from a document and
      a list of aspects. Your task is to:\\n\\n1. Read and understand the aspects\\n-
      Each aspect is identified by an Aspect ID (for example, \\\"A0\\\", \\\"A1\\\",
      etc.), includes a name, and has a description.\\n- Aspects describe themes,
      topics, or criteria that might be addressed in the paragraphs.\\n\\n2. Examine
      each paragraph\\n- Each paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example,
      \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\", etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\\n-
      When available, additional context information for paragraphs (such as formatting,
      list context, or table position) will be provided under \\\"Additional information
      about the paragraph:\\\" sections, which provides important context for understanding
      their structural role and position within the document. Use this information
      to:\\n    -- Understand document hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section
      boundaries)\\n    -- Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list items
      are related, table cells contain associated data)\\n    -- Assess content significance
      (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)\\n- Note that paragraphs are provided
      in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings,
      links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n- Note that paragraphs are listed
      in the same order they appear in the original document; therefore, context from
      surrounding paragraphs may influence whether a particular paragraph is relevant
      to an aspect.\\n- You may be working with document fragments rather than complete
      documents. Focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\n3. Map paragraphs to aspects\\n-
      A paragraph can address one, multiple, or none of the aspects.\\n- If a paragraph
      clearly relates to an aspect (based on the aspect's name and description), include
      the paragraph's ID and provide a justification, detailing why the paragraph
      is relevant to the aspect.\\n- If a paragraph does not relate to an aspect,
      do not include it under that aspect's list.\\n\\n4. Produce the final answer
      in the specified JSON format\\n- Your output must be a JSON array of objects,
      each object corresponding to a single aspect.\\n- For each aspect (in the order
      they are provided), include:\\n    -- aspect_id: The aspect's unique identifier,
      e.g., \\\"A0\\\".\\n    -- paragraphs: An array of objects for each paragraph
      that addresses or relates to the aspect. Each object should include:\\n        ---
      paragraph_id: The provided paragraph ID, e.g., \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P2\\\".\\n        ---
      justification: A justification of why the paragraph is relevant to the aspect.
      Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the content of the paragraph
      to the aspect's defining features. Never reference any of the structural IDs
      provided in this prompt (such as aspect IDs like \\\"A0\\\", or paragraph IDs
      like \\\"P0\\\") in the justification.\\n            ---- Justification should
      be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential details.\\n            ---- Justification
      should be no longer than 2 sentences.\\n            ---- Justification should
      be in English.\\n    -- If an aspect has no related paragraphs, still include
      it with an empty paragraphs array ([]).\\n- Do not add extra commentary, code
      block markers, or any other formatting beyond the JSON array.\\n\\nUse the following
      answer format as a guide for your final answer (remember: no surrounding text
      or ```json delimiters should be included).\\n\\n======\\nANSWER FORMAT (MANDATORY):\\n[\\n

    body: '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You will be assigned tasks involving
      the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within various types of
      documents. Your role is to carefully process the information and provide accurate,
      relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\n\nKEY TERMINOLOGY
      TO UNDERSTAND:\n\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file containing
      written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose, including
      but not limited to:\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms and obligations.\n-
      Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and payments.\n- Curricula
      Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual''s professional experience and
      qualifications.\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents, blueprints,
      photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant information.\n-
      General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain text, tables, images,
      or mixed formats.\nNote that occasionally you may be working with document fragments
      rather than complete documents. These fragments represent portions of a larger
      document and should be analyzed within their limited context. When working with
      fragments, focus on extracting information from the available content without
      making assumptions about missing parts.\n\nDocuments may contain textual or
      visual content:\n- Text-based content: Written information that can be directly
      read and processed.\n- Visual content: Images, charts, diagrams, blueprints,
      tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that require visual interpretation.\n\n2.
      Aspect: A defined area or topic within a document that requires focused attention.
      Each aspect corresponds to a specific subject or theme described in the task.
      For example:\n- Contract Aspects: Payment terms, parties involved, or termination
      clauses.\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates, line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\n-
      CV Aspects: Work experience, education, or skills.\nYou will analyze aspects
      as instructed, considering their relevance and context within the document.\n\n3.
      Concept: A unit of information or an entity relevant to the task. Concepts may
      be derived from an aspect or the broader document context. They represent a
      wide range of data points and insights, from simple entities (names, dates,
      monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions, and answers to specific
      questions. Concepts can be:\n- Factual extractions: Such as a penalty clause
      in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or a certification in a CV.\n-
      Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments, compliance evaluations, or pattern
      identifications.\n- Reasoned conclusions: Such as determining whether a document
      meets specific criteria or answers particular questions.\n- Interpretative judgments:
      Such as ratings, classifications, or qualitative assessments based on document
      content.\n- Label classifications: Content categorization using predefined labels.\n\nCRITICAL
      GUIDELINES FOR YOUR WORK:\n\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information
      that is explicitly stated or can be directly inferred from the document content.
      Avoid speculation or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\n\n-
      Visual content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\n  -- Examine
      all visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams,
      logos, layout structures, etc.\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\n\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\n\n- Systematic analysis: Before
      extracting, thoroughly understand:\n  -- The nature and type of the document\n  --
      The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\n  -- The expected output
      format and structure requirements\n  -- Any constraints or special handling
      instructions\n\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify that:\n  -- All
      extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\n  --
      The output format matches the required schema exactly\n  -- No extraneous information
      has been included\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly populated\n\n-
      Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information qualifies for
      extraction:\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side of exclusion\n  --
      If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most conservative one\n  --
      If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\n\n- Structured output
      compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements. Do not:\n  --
      Add extra fields beyond what is requested\n  -- Modify the structure or field
      names\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\n  -- Use code
      blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\n\nEXPECTED DELIVERABLES:\n-
      Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results based on the
      task requirements.\n- Explanations (when required): When required by the instructions,
      include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\n- Insights (when
      required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends, patterns, or
      noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\n- References (when required):
      When required by the instructions, output references based on which you extracted
      data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the task.\n\n\nBy adhering
      to this framework, you will ensure consistent and high-quality performance across
      diverse document analysis tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"Below you will
      find document text and a list of concepts.\n\nYour task is to:\n1. Read through
      the document text provided.\n    - Note that the document text is provided in
      markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings, links,
      lists, and other markdown syntax.\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts
      list is addressed within the document text.\n3. For each concept that appears,
      extract zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure
      are specified for each concept.\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\n\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      text, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with an empty
      \"extracted_items\" list.\n\nFollow these additional rules:\n\n- Output format:\nProvide
      your answer in only the following answer format (do not include backticks, code
      fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\n\n- Consistency:\n    -- Each
      JSON object in the list must have two keys: \"concept_id\" and \"extracted_items\".\n    --
      The value of \"concept_id\" must match exactly the ID of the concept (for example,
      \"C0\", \"C1\", etc.).\n    -- The value of \"extracted_items\" must be an array
      of objects with mandatory fields \"value\" and \"justification\". If the concept
      is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the array empty ([]).\n        ---
      Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly mentioned) or inferred from
      the content (implied or derivable from the information present).\n        ---
      Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted items for the concept is
      specified under \"Amount of extracted items\". Each extracted item''s object,
      even if there is only one, must be part of the \"extracted_items\" array.\n\n-
      Item object structure:\n    -- value: Mandatory field holding the extracted
      item.\n        --- If a specific structure is provided for a concept under \"Expected
      structure,\" the extracted item value must follow that structure for all extracted
      items corresponding to that concept.\n        --- If a rating scale is provided
      for a concept under \"Rating scale,\" the extracted item value must be within
      that scale.\n        --- If available labels are provided for a concept under
      \"Available labels,\" the extracted item value must be a list containing only
      labels from the predefined set. If none of the predefined labels apply, do not
      extract any items for that concept.\n        --- If there are example items
      (\"Extracted concept examples\"), the extracted item value should follow the
      same style and formatting.\n        --- When extracting string values, translate
      them in English if the original language of the document is not English.\n    --
      justification: Mandatory field holding a justification of why the item was extracted
      for the concept. Ensure the justification is specific and directly ties the
      extracted item to the concept''s defining features. Never reference the concept''s
      ID or any of the structural IDs provided in this prompt (such as paragraph IDs
      like \"P0\", or sentence IDs like \"P0-S0\") in the justification.\n        ---
      Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight only the essential details.\n        ---
      Justification should be no longer than 2 sentences.\n        --- Justification
      should be in English.\n\n- Types of extracted items:\n    -- Each concept specifies
      an \"extracted item type\" (found under \"Concept extracted item type\"). Ensure
      that the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly matches
      that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for integer,
      float for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\n    -- Do not introduce
      any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\n\n- Handling missing or
      multiple items:\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your output should
      still contain an entry for that concept with an empty \"extracted_items\" array.\n    --
      For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if none of the predefined
      labels apply to the content, leave the \"extracted_items\" array empty.\n    --
      For concepts that have an \"Available labels:\" section: if multiple labels

      party for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement, whether
      in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i) $100,000
      or (ii) the total amount paid by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing Party
      under any separate business agreement between the parties during the twelve
      (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation of
      liability is cumulative and not per incident.\n\n2. Penalties for Breach:\n\nIn
      the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
      Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy
      available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach
      of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which
      monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. In addition to injunctive relief,
      the Receiving Party shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of
      $25,000 for each instance of unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
      Information, which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of the
      damages likely to be suffered and not a penalty.\n------\n"}],"model":"gpt-4.1-mini","max_tokens":4096,"stream":false,"temperature":0.3,"top_p":0.3}'

    body: "{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You will be assigned
      tasks involving the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of data within
      various types of documents. Your role is to carefully process the information
      and provide accurate, relevant outputs based on the specific instructions provided.\\n\\nKEY
      TERMINOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND:\\n\\n1. Document: A structured or unstructured file
      containing written or visual content. Documents can vary in type and purpose,
      including but not limited to:\\n- Contracts: Legal agreements defining terms
      and obligations.\\n- Invoices: Financial documents detailing transactions and
      payments.\\n- Curricula Vitae (CVs): Resumes outlining an individual's professional
      experience and qualifications.\\n- Visual Documents: Images, scanned documents,
      blueprints, photographs, charts, diagrams, or screenshots that contain relevant
      information.\\n- General Documents: Any other types of files that may contain
      text, tables, images, or mixed formats.\\nNote that occasionally you may be
      working with document fragments rather than complete documents. These fragments
      represent portions of a larger document and should be analyzed within their
      limited context. When working with fragments, focus on extracting information
      from the available content without making assumptions about missing parts.\\n\\nDocuments
      may contain textual or visual content:\\n- Text-based content: Written information
      that can be directly read and processed.\\n- Visual content: Images, charts,
      diagrams, blueprints, tables, handwritten text, or other visual elements that
      require visual interpretation.\\n\\n2. Aspect: A defined area or topic within
      a document that requires focused attention. Each aspect corresponds to a specific
      subject or theme described in the task. For example:\\n- Contract Aspects: Payment
      terms, parties involved, or termination clauses.\\n- Invoice Aspects: Due dates,
      line-item breakdowns, or tax details.\\n- CV Aspects: Work experience, education,
      or skills.\\nYou will analyze aspects as instructed, considering their relevance
      and context within the document.\\n\\n3. Concept: A unit of information or an
      entity relevant to the task. Concepts may be derived from an aspect or the broader
      document context. They represent a wide range of data points and insights, from
      simple entities (names, dates, monetary values) to complex evaluations, conclusions,
      and answers to specific questions. Concepts can be:\\n- Factual extractions:
      Such as a penalty clause in a contract, a total amount due in an invoice, or
      a certification in a CV.\\n- Analytical insights: Such as risk assessments,
      compliance evaluations, or pattern identifications.\\n- Reasoned conclusions:
      Such as determining whether a document meets specific criteria or answers particular
      questions.\\n- Interpretative judgments: Such as ratings, classifications, or
      qualitative assessments based on document content.\\n- Label classifications:
      Content categorization using predefined labels.\\n\\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR
      YOUR WORK:\\n\\n- Precision and accuracy: Extract only information that is explicitly
      stated or can be directly inferred from the document content. Avoid speculation
      or assumptions beyond what the document content clearly supports.\\n\\n- Visual
      content analysis: When processing visual content (images):\\n  -- Examine all
      visual elements carefully, including text within images, charts, diagrams, logos,
      layout structures, etc.\\n  -- Identify and analyze visual patterns, relationships,
      and structural information that may not be explicitly stated in text.\\n  --
      Consider the visual context and layout as it may provide important semantic
      information.\\n  -- Analyze information in tables, forms, charts, and diagrams
      with attention to their visual structure and relationships.\\n\\n- Contextual
      understanding: Consider the full context when performing extractions. A single
      paragraph or sentence may have different meanings depending on surrounding content,
      document type, and domain-specific terminology.\\n\\n- Systematic analysis:
      Before extracting, thoroughly understand:\\n  -- The nature and type of the
      document\\n  -- The specific aspects or concepts you need to focus on\\n  --
      The expected output format and structure requirements\\n  -- Any constraints
      or special handling instructions\\n\\n- Quality control: After extraction, verify
      that:\\n  -- All extracted information directly relates to the specified aspects/concepts\\n
      \ -- The output format matches the required schema exactly\\n  -- No extraneous
      information has been included\\n  -- All mandatory fields are present and correctly
      populated\\n\\n- Conservative approach: When in doubt about whether information
      qualifies for extraction:\\n  -- If the relevance is unclear, err on the side
      of exclusion\\n  -- If multiple interpretations are possible, choose the most
      conservative one\\n  -- If information is ambiguous, do not force an extraction\\n\\n-
      Structured output compliance: Adhere strictly to the specified JSON format requirements.
      Do not:\\n  -- Add extra fields beyond what is requested\\n  -- Modify the structure
      or field names\\n  -- Include explanatory text outside the JSON structure\\n
      \ -- Use code blocks or formatting markers unless explicitly required\\n\\nEXPECTED
      DELIVERABLES:\\n- Structured outputs: Clearly formatted and well-organized results
      based on the task requirements.\\n- Explanations (when required): When required
      by the instructions, include justifications or reasoning for your interpretations.\\n-
      Insights (when required): When required by the instructions, highlight trends,
      patterns, or noteworthy findings that could add value to the task.\\n- References
      (when required): When required by the instructions, output references based
      on which you extracted data, provided insights, or made conclusions during the
      task.\\n\\n\\nBy adhering to this framework, you will ensure consistent and
      high-quality performance across diverse document analysis tasks.\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Below
      you will find a list of document paragraphs and a list of concepts.\\n\\nYour
      task is to:\\n1. Read through the document paragraphs provided.\\n    - Each
      paragraph is identified by a paragraph ID (for example, \\\"P0\\\", \\\"P1\\\",
      etc.), followed by the full text of the paragraph.\\n    - When available, additional
      context information for paragraphs (such as formatting, list context, or table
      position) will be provided under \\\"Additional information about the paragraph:\\\"
      sections, which provides important context for understanding their structural
      role and position within the document. Use this information to:\\n        --
      Understand document hierarchy (e.g., headings indicate section boundaries)\\n
      \       -- Recognize relationships between content (e.g., list items are related,
      table cells contain associated data)\\n        -- Assess content significance
      (e.g., styled text may indicate importance)\\n    - Note that paragraphs are
      provided in markdown format, which may include formatting elements such as headings,
      links, lists, and other markdown syntax.\\n    - Note that paragraphs are listed
      in the same order they appear in the original document.\\n    - You may be working
      with document fragments rather than complete documents. Focus on extracting
      information from the available content without making assumptions about missing
      parts.\\n2. Identify whether each concept in the concepts list is addressed
      within the document paragraphs.\\n3. For each concept that appears, extract
      zero or more items relevant to that concept. The item format and structure are
      specified for each concept.\\n4. Produce a JSON array containing your extracted
      data, in the provided format.\\n\\nIf a concept is not addressed in the document
      paragraphs, you must still include an entry in the final JSON output but with
      an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\" list.\\n\\nFollow these additional rules:\\n\\n-
      Output format:\\nProvide your answer in only the following answer format (do
      not include backticks, code fences, or any introductory/explanatory text).\\n\\n-
      Consistency:\\n    -- Each JSON object in the list must have two keys: \\\"concept_id\\\"
      and \\\"extracted_items\\\".\\n    -- The value of \\\"concept_id\\\" must match
      exactly the ID of the concept (for example, \\\"C0\\\", \\\"C1\\\", etc.).\\n
      \   -- The value of \\\"extracted_items\\\" must be an array of objects with
      mandatory fields \\\"value\\\", \\\"justification\\\", and \\\"reference_paragraph_ids\\\".
      If the concept is not addressed or there are no items to extract, leave the
      array empty ([]).\\n        --- Extracted items may be found directly (explicitly
      mentioned) or inferred from the content (implied or derivable from the information
      present).\\n        --- Guidance regarding the possible amount of extracted
      items for the concept is specified under \\\"Amount of extracted items\\\".
      Each extracted item's object, even if there is only one, must be part of the
      \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- Item object structure:\\n    -- value:
      Mandatory field holding the extracted item.\\n        --- If a specific structure
      is provided for a concept under \\\"Expected structure,\\\" the extracted item
      value must follow that structure for all extracted items corresponding to that
      concept.\\n        --- If a rating scale is provided for a concept under \\\"Rating
      scale,\\\" the extracted item value must be within that scale.\\n        ---
      If available labels are provided for a concept under \\\"Available labels,\\\"
      the extracted item value must be a list containing only labels from the predefined
      set. If none of the predefined labels apply, do not extract any items for that
      concept.\\n        --- If there are example items (\\\"Extracted concept examples\\\"),
      the extracted item value should follow the same style and formatting.\\n        ---
      When extracting string values, translate them in English if the original language
      of the document is not English.\\n    -- justification: Mandatory field holding
      a justification of why the item was extracted for the concept. Ensure the justification
      is specific and directly ties the extracted item to the concept's defining features.
      Never reference the concept's ID or any of the structural IDs provided in this
      prompt (such as paragraph IDs like \\\"P0\\\", or sentence IDs like \\\"P0-S0\\\")
      in the justification.\\n        --- Justification should be brief, i.e. highlight
      only the essential details.\\n        --- Justification should be no longer
      than 2 sentences.\\n        --- Justification should be in English.\\n    --
      reference_paragraph_ids: Mandatory field holding the IDs of the document paragraphs
      based on which the item was extracted for the concept. Ensure such paragraphs
      directly tie the extracted item to the concept's defining features. Each paragraph
      ID must match exactly the provided ID for the paragraph (for example, \\\"P0\\\",
      \\\"P1\\\", etc.).\\n\\n- Types of extracted items:\\n    -- Each concept specifies
      an \\\"extracted item type\\\" (found under \\\"Concept extracted item type\\\").
      Ensure that the value of each of the extracted items for the concept strictly
      matches that type. Python types are provided (e.g., str for string, int for
      integer, float for floating-point number, dict for object, etc.).\\n    -- Do
      not introduce any extra fields or modify the specified structure.\\n\\n- Handling
      missing or multiple items:\\n    -- If a concept is not mentioned at all, your
      output should still contain an entry for that concept with an empty \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array.\\n    -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section:
      if none of the predefined labels apply to the content, leave the \\\"extracted_items\\\"
      array empty.\\n    -- For concepts that have an \\\"Available labels:\\\" section:
      if multiple labels apply to the same instance or context, include them all in
      a single extracted item with multiple labels in the \\\"labels\\\" array (e.g.,
      {\\\"labels\\\": [\\\"label1\\\", \\\"label2\\\"]}). Only create multiple extracted
      items if there are genuinely distinct instances or contexts that warrant separate
      classification.\\n    -- For concepts that do not have an \\\"Available labels:\\\"
      section: if multiple items are found for a concept, include each as a separate
      entry within the \\\"extracted_items\\\" array.\\n\\n- No additional text:\\n
      \   -- Do not include any headers, explanations, or text outside of the JSON
      array.\\n    -- Do not wrap your JSON response in backticks or any other formatting
