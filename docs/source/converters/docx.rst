:og:description: ContextGem: DOCX Converter

DOCX Converter
===============

ContextGem provides built-in converter to easily transform DOCX files into LLM-ready ContextGem document objects.

* üìë Extracts information that other open-source tools often do not capture: misaligned tables, comments, footnotes, textboxes, headers/footers, and embedded images
* üß© Preserves document structure with rich metadata for improved LLM analysis
* üõ†Ô∏è Custom native converter that directly processes Word XML


üöÄ Usage
----------

.. literalinclude:: ../../../dev/usage_examples/readme/docx_converter.py
   :language: python


üîÑ Conversion Process
----------------------

The :class:`~contextgem.public.converters.DocxConverter` performs the following operations when converting a DOCX file to a ContextGem Document with :meth:`~contextgem.public.converters.DocxConverter.convert` method:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 50 25

   * - Elements
     - Extraction Details
     - Control Parameter (Default)
   * - **Text**
     - Extracts the full document text as raw text, and optionally applies markdown processing and formatting while preserving raw text separately
     - ``apply_markdown=True``
   * - **Paragraphs**
     - Extracts :class:`~contextgem.public.paragraphs.Paragraph` objects with rich metadata serving as additional context for LLM (e.g., *"Style: Normal, Table: 3, Row: 1, Column: 3, Table Cell"*)
     - *Always included*
   * - **Headings**
     - Preserves heading levels and formats as markdown headings when in markdown mode
     - *Always included*
   * - **Lists**
     - Maintains list hierarchy, numbering, and formatting with proper indentation and list type information
     - *Always included*
   * - **Tables**
     - Preserves table structure and formats tables in markdown mode
     - ``include_tables=True``
   * - **Headers & Footers**
     - Captures document headers and footers with appropriate metadata
     - ``include_headers=True`` / ``include_footers=True``
   * - **Footnotes**
     - Extracts footnotes with references and preserves connection to original text
     - ``include_footnotes=True``
   * - **Comments**
     - Preserves document comments with author information and timestamps
     - ``include_comments=True``
   * - **Links**
     - Processes and formats hyperlinks, preserving both link text and target URLs
     - ``include_links=True``
   * - **Text Boxes**
     - Extracts text from various text box formats
     - ``include_textboxes=True``
   * - **Inline Formatting**
     - Applies inline formatting such as bold, italic, underline, etc. when in markdown mode
     - ``include_inline_formatting=True``
   * - **Images**
     - Extracts embedded images and converts them to :class:`~contextgem.public.images.Image` objects for further processing with vision models
     - ``include_images=True``
   * - **Tables of Contents**
     - Extracts table of contents sections and preserves their structure
     - ``include_toc=True``

üí• Beyond Standard Libraries
------------------------------

Our evaluation of popular open-source DOCX processing libraries revealed critical limitations: most packages either omit important elements (e.g. comments, footnotes, or embedded images), fail to handle complex structures (such as inconsistently formatted tables), or cannot extract paragraphs with the rich metadata needed for LLM processing.

While it would have been much easier to use an existing open-source package as a dependency, these limitations compelled us to build a custom solution. The :class:`~contextgem.public.converters.DocxConverter` was developed specifically to address these gaps, ensuring extraction of the most commonly occurring DOCX elements with their contextual relationships preserved.


‚ÑπÔ∏è Current Limitations
------------------------

DocxConverter has the following limitations:

* Drawings such as charts are skipped as it is challenging to represent them in text format.
* In specially marked sections (headers, footers, footnotes, comments), inline markdown formatting (bold, italic, etc.) and hyperlink formatting is currently not supported.
