:og:description: ContextGem: Supported LLM Providers and Models


Supported LLMs
===============

ContextGem supports all LLM providers and models available through the LiteLLM integration. This means you can use models from major cloud providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Azure, as well as run local models through providers like Ollama and LM Studio.

ContextGem works with both types of LLM architectures:

* Reasoning/CoT-capable models (e.g., ``openai/o4-mini``, ``ollama/deepseek-r1:32b``)
* Non-reasoning models (e.g., ``openai/gpt-4.1``, ``ollama/llama3.1:8b``)

For a complete list of supported providers, see the `LiteLLM Providers documentation <https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers>`_.


‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-based LLMs
---------------------

You can initialize cloud-based LLMs by specifying the provider and model name in the format ``<provider>/<model_name>``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../dev/usage_examples/docs/llms/llm_init/llm_api.py
   :language: python
   :caption: Using cloud LLM providers


üíª Local LLMs
---------------

For local LLMs, you'll need to specify the provider, model name, and the appropriate API base URL:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../dev/usage_examples/docs/llms/llm_init/llm_local.py
   :language: python
   :caption: Using local LLM providers


For a complete list of configuration options available when initializing DocumentLLM instances, see the next section :doc:`llm_config`.
