:og:description: ContextGem: Optimizing for Cost

Optimizing for Cost
====================

ContextGem offers several strategies to optimize for cost efficiency while maintaining extraction quality:

- **üí∏ Select Cost-Efficient Models**: Use smaller/distilled non-reasoning LLMs for extracting aspects and basic concepts (e.g. titles, payment amounts, dates).
- **‚öôÔ∏è Use Default Parameters**: All the extractions will be processed in as few LLM calls as possible.
- **üìâ Enable Justifications Only When Necessary**: Do not use justifications for simple aspects or concepts. This will reduce the number of tokens generated.
- **üìä Monitor Usage and Cost**: Track LLM calls, token consumption, and cost to identify optimization opportunities.
