:og:description: ContextGem: Creating Documents

Creating Documents
===================

This guide explains how to create and configure :class:`~contextgem.public.documents.Document` instances to process textual and visual content for analysis.

Documents serve as the container for the content from which information (aspects and concepts) can be extracted.


‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Parameters
----------------------------

The minimum configuration for a document requires either ``raw_text``, ``paragraphs``, or ``images``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../dev/usage_examples/docstrings/documents/def_document.py
   :language: python
   :caption: Document creation

|

The :class:`~contextgem.public.documents.Document` class accepts the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 15 15 45

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Default Value
     - Description
   * - ``raw_text``
     - ``str | None``
     - ``None``
     - The main text of the document as a single string.
   * - ``paragraphs``
     - ``list[Paragraph]``
     - ``[]``
     - List of :class:`~contextgem.public.paragraphs.Paragraph` instances in consecutive order as they appear in the document. Normally auto-populated from ``raw_text``.
   * - ``images``
     - ``list[Image]``
     - ``[]``
     - List of :class:`~contextgem.public.images.Image` instances attached to or representing the document. Used for visual content analysis.
   * - ``aspects``
     - ``list[Aspect]``
     - ``[]``
     - List of :class:`~contextgem.public.aspects.Aspect` instances associated with the document for focused analysis. Must have unique names and descriptions. See :doc:`../aspects/aspects` for more details.
   * - ``concepts``
     - ``list[_Concept]``
     - ``[]``
     - List of ``_Concept`` instances associated with the document for information extraction. Must have unique names and descriptions. See supported concept types in :doc:`../concepts/supported_concepts`.
   * - ``paragraph_segmentation_mode``
     - ``Literal["newlines", "sat"]``
     - ``"newlines"``
     - Mode for paragraph segmentation. ``"newlines"`` splits on newline characters, ``"sat"`` uses a SaT (Segment Any Text) model for intelligent segmentation.
   * - ``sat_model_id``
     - ``SaTModelId``
     - ``"sat-3l-sm"``
     - SaT model ID for paragraph/sentence segmentation or a local path to a SaT model. See `wtpsplit models <https://github.com/segment-any-text/wtpsplit>`_ for available options.
   * - ``pre_segment_sentences``
     - ``bool``
     - ``False``
     - Whether to pre-segment sentences during Document initialization. When ``False``, sentence segmentation is deferred until sentences are actually needed, improving initialization performance.


üîÑ DOCX Document Conversion
----------------------------

ContextGem provides a built-in :class:`~contextgem.public.converters.docx.DocxConverter` to easily transform DOCX files into LLM-ready :class:`~contextgem.public.documents.Document` instances.

For detailed usage examples and configuration options, see :doc:`../converters/docx`.


üéØ Adding Aspects and Concepts for Extraction
-----------------------------------------------

Before extracting information from a document with an LLM, you must define and add **aspects** and **concepts** to your document instance. These components serve as the foundation for targeted analysis and structured information extraction.

**Aspects** define the text segments (sections, topics, themes) to be extracted from the document. They can be combined with concepts for comprehensive analysis.

**Concepts** define specific data points to be extracted or inferred from the document content: entities, insights, structured objects, classifications, numerical calculations, dates, ratings, and assessments.

For detailed guidance on creating and configuring these components, see:

- :doc:`../aspects/aspects` - Complete guide to defining and using aspects
- :doc:`../concepts/supported_concepts` - All available concept types and how to use them
