ContextGem is an LLM framework for easier, faster extraction of structured data and insights from documents through powerful abstractions.


## üíé Why ContextGem?

Most popular LLM frameworks for extracting structured data from documents require extensive boilerplate code to extract even basic information. This significantly increases development time and complexity.

ContextGem addresses this challenge by providing a flexible, intuitive framework that extracts structured data and insights from documents with minimal effort. Complex, most time-consuming parts are handled with **powerful abstractions**, eliminating boilerplate code and reducing development overhead.

## üéØ Focused document analysis

ContextGem leverages LLMs' long context windows to deliver superior extraction accuracy from individual documents. Unlike RAG approaches that often [struggle with complex concepts and nuanced insights](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/raging-contracts-pitfalls-rag-contract-review-shcherbak-ai-ptg3f), ContextGem capitalizes on [continuously expanding context capacity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12962), evolving LLM capabilities, and decreasing costs. This focused approach enables direct information extraction from complete documents, eliminating retrieval inconsistencies while optimizing for in-depth single-document analysis. While this delivers maximum accuracy for individual documents, ContextGem does not currently support cross-document querying or corpus-wide retrieval - for these use cases, traditional RAG systems (e.g., LlamaIndex, Haystack) remain more appropriate.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

ContextGem is at an early stage. Our development roadmap includes:

- **Enhanced Analytical Abstractions**: Building more sophisticated analytical layers on top of the core extraction workflow to enable deeper insights and more complex document understanding
- **API Simplification**: Continuing to refine and streamline the API surface to make document analysis more intuitive and accessible
- **Terminology Refinement**: Improving consistency and clarity of terminology throughout the framework to enhance developer experience

We are committed to making ContextGem the most effective tool for extracting structured information from documents.
