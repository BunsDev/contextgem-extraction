# Quick Start Example - Extracting anomalies from a document, with source references and justifications

# Example document instance
# Document content is shortened for brevity

# Create an LLM for extracting data and insights from the document

    # see the docs for more configuration options

# Extract information from the document
doc = llm.extract_all(doc)  # or use async version llm.extract_all_async(doc)

# Access extracted information in the document object
print(
    doc.concepts[0].extracted_items
)  # extracted items with references & justifications
# or doc.get_concept_by_name("Anomalies").extracted_items
